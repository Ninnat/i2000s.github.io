<p><em>The following is adapted from Chapter 2 of my thesis, which is an introduction to the representation theory of Lie groups and their associated homogeneous spaces.</em></p>
<p>A <em>group homomorphism</em> between two groups is a map <span class="math">\(\varphi:G \to G&#39;\)</span> that respects the group composition law: <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2) &amp;= \varphi(g_1 g_2)\end{aligned}\]</span> for all <span class="math">\(g_1,g_2 \in G\)</span>. This implies, among other things, that if <span class="math">\(e\)</span> is the identity element of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\varphi(e)\)</span> is the identity element of <span class="math">\(G&#39;\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\varphi(g)^{-1} = \varphi(g^{-1})\)</span>. The <em>kernel</em> <span class="math">\(\ker \varphi\)</span> of a homomorphism <span class="math">\(\varphi\)</span> is the set of elements of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> that are sent to the identity element.</p>
<p>A <em>representation</em> of a group <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a homomorphism from <span class="math">\(G\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\gr{GL}{V}\)</span>, the group of all invertible matrices on <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\rep: G \to \gr{GL}{V}.\end{aligned}\]</span> We also say that <span class="math">\((\rep,V)\)</span> is a <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-representation. When no confusion arises, we also call the vector space <span class="math">\(V\)</span> itself a representation. A representation <span class="math">\(\rep\)</span> is said to be <em>faithful</em> if the map <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> is one-one. A <em>subrepresentation</em> is a subspace of <span class="math">\(V\)</span> stable under <span class="math">\(G\)</span> i.e. closed under every <span class="math">\(\rep(g)\)</span>. An <em>irreducible representation</em> or <em>irrep</em> for short is one that has no nontrivial subrepresentation.</p>
<p>A reducible representation may not decompose as a direct sum of subrepresentations. This is true even for a single matrix. A matrix always has at least one eigenvector in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> but it may not be diagonalizable. For instance, the group of integers with addition as group multiplication <span class="math">\((\mathbb{Z},+)\)</span> has a two-dimensional representation with the generator <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\rep(e) &amp;= \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix},\end{aligned}\]</span> which cannot be diagonalized. A representation <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is <em>completely reducible</em> if for any subrepresentation <span class="math">\(W \subset V\)</span>, there is a complementary subrepresentation <span class="math">\(W&#39;\subset V\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(V \simeq W \oplus W&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>As every vector space comes with the dual space, every representation comes with the dual representation. Recall that the dual space <span class="math">\(V^*\)</span> of a complex vector space is the vector space of all linear maps from <span class="math">\(V\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(V^*\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V\)</span> have the same dimension, they are isomorphic as vector spaces <span class="math">\(V^* \simeq V\)</span> but not naturally. (We do not assume the Hermitian inner product structure for a moment.) Nevertheless, if we pick an ordered basis <span class="math">\(\{ \ket{v_j} \}\)</span>, an isomorphism amounts to the transposition—simply flipping the ket <span class="math">\(\ket{v_j}\)</span> to the bra <span class="math">\(\bra{v_j}\)</span>. The <em>dual representation</em> <span class="math">\((\rep^*,V^*)\)</span> of a representation <span class="math">\((\rep,V)\)</span> can be defined in <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~reb/courses/261/31.pdf">several ways</a>, which can be quite confusing. We follow Fultan and Harris <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and define the <em>right action</em> <span class="math">\(\bra{u} \rep(g^*)\)</span>, so that <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
(\bra{u} \rep^*(g) ) (\rep(g) \ket{v}) &amp;= \braket{u|v},\end{aligned}\]</span> for all <span class="math">\(\ket{u},\ket{v} \in V\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g \in G\)</span>. (The inverse is necessary to make <span class="math">\(\rep^*\)</span> a group homomorphism.) Note that if we want to turn the right action to the <em>left action</em> on <span class="math">\(\ket{u}\)</span>, the matrix representation of <span class="math">\(\rep^*(g)\)</span> is given by the transpose <span class="math">\(\rep^T(g^{-1})\)</span> so that <span class="math">\(\bra{u} \rep^*(g) = \bra{\rep^T(g^{-1})u}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A representation is <em>unitary</em> if it is equivalent to a representation in which every <span class="math">\(\rep(g)\)</span> is a unitary operator, <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\rep\dgg (g) \rep(g) &amp;= \id,\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math">\(\rep\dgg (g)\)</span> is the entry-wise complex conjugate transpose of <span class="math">\(\rep(g)\)</span>. For a unitary representation, the right-action version of the dual representation coincides with the <em>Hermitian dual representation</em> <span class="math">\(\rho\dgg (g)\)</span>, while the left-action version coincides with the <em>complex conjugate representation</em>. Hhigh energy physicists like to use the latter and signify the dual representation by an overbar.</p>
<h2 id="intertwiners-and-schurs-lemma">Intertwiners and Schur’s lemma</h2>
For complex vector spaces <span class="math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math">\(W\)</span>, define <span class="math">\(\text{Hom}(V,W)\)</span> to be the vector space of linear maps (linear homomorphisms) from <span class="math">\(V\)</span> to <span class="math">\(W\)</span>. When <span class="math">\(V = W\)</span>, this space is also denoted by <span class="math">\(\text{End}(V)\)</span> (endomorphisms). Naturally, <span class="math">\(\text{Hom}(V,W) \simeq W \otimes V^*\)</span>. When <span class="math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math">\(W\)</span> are endowed with <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-representations <span class="math">\(\rep_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\rep_2\)</span>, respectively, an <em>intertwiner</em> between <span class="math">\(\rep_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\rep_2\)</span> is defined as a linear map <span class="math">\(\varphi\)</span> that makes the diagram below commutative for any <span class="math">\(g\in G\)</span>.

\xymatrix{V\ar[r]^{\varphi}\ar[d]_{\rep_1(g)} & W\ar[d]^{\rep_2(g)} \\
    V\ar[r]^{\varphi} & W}\end{aligned}$$-->
<p>In other words, <span class="math">\(\varphi\)</span> commutes with the <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-action: <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\varphi \rep_1 (g) &amp;= \rep_2 (g) \varphi.\end{aligned}\]</span> The set of all such intertwiners forms a subspace of <span class="math">\(\text{Hom}(V,W)\)</span> denoted by <span class="math">\(\text{Hom}_G (V,W)\)</span> or, again, <span class="math">\(\text{End}_G (V)\)</span> when <span class="math">\(V \simeq W\)</span>. Two representations <span class="math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math">\(W\)</span> of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> are said to be <em>equivalent</em> <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
V \stackrel{G}{\simeq} W\end{aligned}\]</span> when <span class="math">\(\text{Hom}_G (V,W)\)</span> contains an invertible intertwiner. In this case, they are related just by a change of basis.</p>
<p>Schur proved a collection of elementary but very powerful observations that, in an algebraically closed field <span class="math">\(K\)</span> (such as <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>), intertwiners between irreps behave like the Kronecker delta: <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\text{Hom}_G (V,W) \simeq
    \begin{cases}
        K, &amp; V \simeq W, \\
        0, &amp; V \not\simeq W.
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong> (Schur):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Every intertwiner between irreps of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is either an isomorphism or zero,</p></li>
<li><p>For a finite-dimensional irrep <span class="math">\(V\)</span> in an algebraically closed field <span class="math">\(K\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\text{End}_G (V)\)</span> is proportional to the identity operator, <span class="math">\(\text{End}_G (V) = k\id\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k \in K\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Proof.</em> The first observation is proved by noting that the image and the kernel of an intertwiner are subrepresentations. If either is nontrivial, then the irrep has a nontrivial subrepresentation, which is a contradiction.</p>
<p>For the second observation, let <span class="math">\(\varphi \in \text{End}_G (V)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> be an eigenvalue (which exists because <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is algebraically closed). Consider <span class="math">\(\varphi - \lambda \id\)</span>. It is also in <span class="math">\(\text{Hom}_G (V)\)</span> because <span class="math">\(\id\)</span> commutes with every operator on <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. But <span class="math">\(\ker (\varphi - \lambda \id)\)</span> is a subrepresentation. Therefore <span class="math">\(\varphi - \lambda \id\)</span> must be the zero map i.e. <span class="math">\(\varphi = \lambda \id\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\square\)</span></p>
<p>The assumption that <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is algebraically closed is necessary. Consider a representation of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}_4\)</span> on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> as discrete rotations with the generator <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\rep(e) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}.\end{aligned}\]</span> It is irreducible because <span class="math">\(\rep(e)\)</span> cannot be diagonalized over <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. But every <span class="math">\(\rep(g)\)</span> commutes with matrices of the form <span class="math">\(a\id + b\rep(e)\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(a,b \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, a two-dimensional real vector space.</p>
<p>An easy corollary is that every complex irrep of an abelian group is one-dimensional because <span class="math">\(\rep(g_1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\rep(g_2)\)</span> commute for every <span class="math">\(g_1,g_2 \in G\)</span>. So they are all proportional to the identity operator.</p>
<h2 id="every-finite-dimensional-representation-of-a-compact-group-is-unitary-and-completely-reducible">Every finite-dimensional representation of a compact group is unitary and completely reducible</h2>
<p>Any finite-dimensional representation of a compact group, possessing a Haar measure, is unitary. A measure <span class="math">\(dg\)</span> on <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a <em>Haar measure</em> when it is left-invariant i.e. for any integrable function <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\int dg_1 f(g_2 g_1) &amp;= \int dg_1 f(g_1),\end{aligned}\]</span> and normalized, <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\int dg &amp;= 1.\end{aligned}\]</span> For a compact group, it is unique and also right-invariant <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\int dg_1 f(g_1 g_2) &amp;= \int dg_1 f(g_1).\end{aligned}\]</span> (Of course, when <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is finite this is just a sum.) Armed with the Haar measure, if <span class="math">\(\rep(g)\)</span> is not unitary under some sesquilinear inner product <span class="math">\(\braket{v|w}\)</span>, redefine the inner product to be the average <span class="math">\(\int dg \braket{\rep(g)v|\rep(g)w}\)</span>. This new inner product (which amounts to a change of basis) can be seen to be invariant under the <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-action: <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\int dg_1 \braket{\rep(g_1)v|\rep^*(g_2) \rep(g_2)|\rep(g_1)w}
&amp;= \int dg_1 \braket{\rep(g_2 g_1)v|\rep(g_2 g_1)w} \\
&amp;= \int dg \braket{\rep(g)v|\rep(g)w}.\end{aligned}\]</span> where we have used the left-invariance of the Haar measure. Thus unitarity is not an additional assumption when we deal with compact groups. The existence of an invariant inner product also provides an easy proof that every finite-dimensional representation is completely reducible. Given a subrepresentation <span class="math">\(W\)</span> of <span class="math">\(V\)</span>, the orthogonal complement <span class="math">\(W^{\perp}\)</span> is also stable under <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math">\(V \simeq W \oplus W^{\perp}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="isotypic-decomposition">Isotypic decomposition</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\hat{G}\)</span> be the collection of all inequivalent irreps of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. A completely reducible representation (by definition) decomposes into the orthogonal direct sum of irreps <span class="math">\(V_{\lambda}\)</span> <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
V &amp;\stackrel{G}{\simeq} \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \hat{G}} \bigoplus^{n_{\lambda}} V_{\lambda},\end{aligned}\]</span> each with (possibly zero) <em>multiplicity</em> <span class="math">\(n_{\lambda}\)</span>. A decomposition is said to be <em>multiplicity-free</em> if every <span class="math">\(n_{\lambda}\)</span> is either 0 or 1. By Schur’s lemma, <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\text{Hom}_G (V_{\lambda},V) &amp;= \bigoplus^{n_{\lambda}} \text{Hom}_G ( V_{\lambda}, V_{\lambda} ) = \mathbb{C}^{n_{\lambda}}.\end{aligned}\]</span> <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}^{n_{\lambda}}\)</span> is called the <em>multiplicity space</em> where <span class="math">\(n_{\lambda} = \dim \text{Hom}_G (V_{\lambda},V)\)</span>. Putting these together, we obtain the <em>isotypic decomposition</em> of <span class="math">\(V\)</span>: <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
V &amp;\stackrel{G}{\simeq} \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \hat{G}} V_{\lambda} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{n_{\lambda}}
\stackrel{G}{\simeq} \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \hat{G}} V_{\lambda} \otimes \text{Hom}_G (V_{\lambda},V).\end{aligned}\]</span> An important special case is when <span class="math">\(V\)</span> is a tensor product of irreps. <span class="math">\(V\)</span> may not be irreducible and we have the <em>Clebsch-Gordan decomposition</em> <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
    V_{\mu} \otimes V_{\nu} &amp;\stackrel{G}{\simeq} \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \hat{G}} V_{\lambda} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{n^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}}.
\end{aligned}\]</span> The collection of <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> that appears in the direct sum is called the <em>Clebsch-Gordan series</em>, and the overlap between vectors in <span class="math">\(V_{\mu} \otimes V_{\nu}\)</span> and vectors in <span class="math">\(V_{\lambda}\)</span> are <em>Clebsch-Gordan coefficients</em>. When <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a unitary group, the <span class="math">\(n^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}\)</span> are called <em>Richardson-Littlewood coefficients</em>.</p>
<h2 id="fourier-analysis">Fourier analysis</h2>
<p>For a finite group <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, define an orthonormal basis <span class="math">\(\{\ket{g}|g\in G\}\)</span>. Its complex span, the <em>group algebra</em> <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}[G]\)</span>, is an algebra (a vector space in which two vectors can be multiplied) with multiplication <span class="math">\(*\)</span> inherited from group multiplication <span class="math">\(\ket{g_1}*\ket{g_2} = \ket{g_1g_2}\)</span>: <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\left( \sum_{g_1} f_{g_1} \ket{g_1} \right) * \left( \sum_{g_2} h_{g_2} \ket{g_2} \right)
&amp;= \sum_{g_1,g_2} f_{g_1} h_{g_1^{-1} g} \ket{g}.\end{aligned}\]</span> Here the expression on the right is a discrete analogue of the convolution <span class="math">\((f*h)(x) = \int dy f(x)h(y-x)\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}[G]\)</span> can also be naturally thought of as a representation of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> by left multiplication <span class="math">\(\rep_L(g_1) \ket{g_2} = \ket{g_1 g_2}\)</span>, called the <em>left regular representation</em> <span class="math">\((\rep_L,\mathbb{C}[G])\)</span>, or right multiplication <span class="math">\(\rep_R(g_1)\ket{g_2} = \ket{g_2 g_1^{-1}}\)</span>, called the <em>right regular representation</em> <span class="math">\((\rep_R,\mathbb{C}[G])\)</span>. When <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is infinite, we can interpret <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}[G]\)</span> to be the convolution algebra of functions on <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, provided that we agree on what we mean by a function. The standard choice is for <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}[G]\)</span> to be <span class="math">\(L^2(G)\)</span>, the space of square-integrable functions. The group action on a function is dual to the action on group algebra, <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\rep(g)f(x) &amp;= f(g^{-1} x),\end{aligned}\]</span> <span class="math">\(x \in G\)</span>, since a function is a linear map from <span class="math">\(G\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The isotypic decomposition of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}[G]\)</span> is <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{C}[G] &amp;\stackrel{G}{\simeq} \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \hat{G}} V_{\lambda} \otimes \text{Hom}_G (V_{\lambda},\mathbb{C}[G])
\stackrel{G}{\simeq} \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \hat{G}} V_{\lambda} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{\dim V}.
\end{aligned}\]</span> Since the left and right representations commute, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}[G]\)</span> can also be thought of as a representation of <span class="math">\(G \times G\)</span>. Under this <span class="math">\(G \times G\)</span>-action, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{C}[G]\)</span> decomposes in the multiplicity-free manner: <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:regular decomposition}
\mathbb{C}[G] \stackrel{G \times G}{\simeq} \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \hat{G}} V_{\lambda} \otimes V_{\lambda}^*
\stackrel{G \times G}{\simeq} \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \hat{G}} \text{End}(V_{\lambda}),
\end{aligned}\]</span> where the representation <span class="math">\((\rep_L \otimes \id, G\times G)\)</span> acts on <span class="math">\(V_{\lambda}\)</span> and <span class="math">\((\id \otimes \rep_R, G\times G)\)</span> acts on <span class="math">\(V_{\lambda}^*\)</span>.</p>
<p>The unitary change of basis from <span class="math">\(\{\ket{g}\}\)</span> to an orthonormal basis on the right hand side of  is the <em>Fourier transform</em>. Its explicit matrix form, given an orthonormal basis <span class="math">\(\{\ket{\lambda,j,k}|1\le j,k\le d_{\lambda}\}\)</span> for each <span class="math">\(V_{\lambda} \otimes V_{\lambda}^*\)</span>, is <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}

\label{Fourier transform}

<p>For the cyclic group <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}_n\)</span>, this is just the discrete Fourier transform <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{Fourier transform:Z_n}
U_{\text{FT}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{x,y=0}^{n-1} e^{2\pi iัxััy/n} \ketbra{y}{x}.  \end{aligned}\]</span> More generally, for any abelian group, <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{Fourier transform:abelian}
\ket{\tilde{g}} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{|G|}} \sum_{\lambda \in \hat{G}} \chi_{\lambda}(g) \ket{\lambda},

The Fourier transform on an abelian group is much more well-behaved than the general case because the collection of all distinct irreps <span class="math">\(\hat{G}\)</span> also comes equipped with the abelian group structure. <span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
\chi^{-1}(g) &amp;= \chi(g^{-1}) = \conj \chi(g) \\
\chi(g_1)\chi(g_2) &amp;= \chi(g_1 g_2).\end{aligned}\]</span> In this case, <span class="math">\(\hat{G}\)</span> is called the <em>dual group</em>. The <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontryagin_duality">compact-discrete duality</a></em> states that <span class="math">\(\hat{G}\)</span> is compact if <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is discrete and vice versa. Familiar dual pairs are <span class="math">\(G = \hat{G} = \mathbb{Z}_d\)</span>, <span class="math">\(G = \hat{G} = \mathbb{R}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(G = \gr{U}{1}\)</span> dual to <span class="math">\(\hat{G} = \mathbb{Z}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For compact groups, we have the celebrated</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong> (Peter-Weyl): For a compact Lie group <span class="math">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V_{\lambda}\)</span> its irrep, the orthogonal direct sum <span class="math">\(\bigoplus_{\lambda \in \hat{G}} V_{\lambda} \otimes V_{\lambda}^*\)</span> is dense in <span class="math">\(L^2(G)\)</span> with respect to the supremum norm <span class="math">\(||f||_{\infty} = \sup |f(g)|\)</span>. Moreover, every <span class="math">\(V_{\lambda}\)</span> is finite-dimensional.</p>
<p>In other words, every function in <span class="math">\(L^2(G)\)</span> can be approximated arbitrarily closely in the supremum norm by a finite linear combinations of the matrix elements <span class="math">\(\{ \sqrt{d_{\lambda}} \rep_{\lambda}(g)_{jk} \}\)</span>.</p>
