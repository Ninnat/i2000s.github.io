What does it mean to simulate something?

> One might naively expect that a subclass of IQP, which is mapped into an exactly solvable Ising
model, is classically simulatable in the strong sense [18, 19], since the joint probability distribution
of the output can be calculated efficiently. However, there are exponentially many instances of the
measurement outcome, and hence an efficient calculation of the joint probability distribution of an
output does not directly applied to an efficient weak simulation of IQP. For example, in Ref. [18], it
3is pointed out that there exists the case where the joint probability distribution is easily calculated
but its marginals are rather hard to calculate. In order to construct an efficient weak simulation of
IQP, we need the marginal distributions

    $\mathcal{D}$ is a (state) $t$-design if the average over $\mathcal{D}$ mimics average over the Haar measure:
    $$ \frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}|}\sum_{\psi\in\mathcal{D}} \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}^{\otimes t} = \int_{\psi\in\mathrm{Haar}} \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}^{\otimes t}.$$
    Since the RHS commutes with $U^{\otimes t}$, it must be a sum of irrep projectors by Schur's lemma. Since $\ketbra{\psi}{\psi}^{\otimes t}$ lies entirely in the symmetric subspace, it is the projector onto the symmetric subspace, hence the equivalent condition for $\mathcal{D}$ to be a $t$-design:
    $$ \frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}|}\sum_{\psi\in\mathcal{D}} \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}^{\otimes t} = \frac{\Pi_{\Sym{t}}}{\Tr (\Pi_{\Sym{t}}) }$$
    Now for a different group $G$, the $G$-twirl (GCS) will still be a $t$-design if the symmetric subspace is a $G$-irrep because of Schur's lemma.

  > The biography came to a point where Landau, at the age of 54, has a very serious automobile accident. He’s in a coma for a month and a half. Then his son Igor comes to the hospital to check on his father, and he’s awake. It’s a tear-jerking scene. However, Landau doesn’t say, “Oh, I’m happy to be alive,” or “My son, Igor,” or anything like that. Instead, he says, “Igor, you’re here. What’s the indefinite integral of $dx$ over $\sin x$?”

  > I decided, as a personal revenge on Landau, to study the subject up to the point where I could solve this exercise.
