# This Site

Why writing?

I write because I want to read, to repeat myself less, and to improve by rewriting. [^1] I imagine most things I write to be drafts in progress, toward something
I have yet to recognize. Blogging went back to my [current Wordpress blog](https://ninnatdangniam.wordpress.com/),
 my [previous Wordpress blog](https://truecrimson.wordpress.com/) and a now-defunct Windows Live Blog,
and are all parts of my [Long Content](http://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). 

Expect more from this section once there is more content.

# Me

I'm on
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ninnattom.dangniam) to keep in touch with friends and family. You can also find photos from my trips to Japan there. [^2]

* [PhysicsForums](https://www.physicsforums.com/members/truecrimson.187431/) almost exclusively in the quantum subforum
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/WhataBeautifulPodunk/), as of now mostly on `/r/physics,/r/quantum,/r/meditation` and `/r/guiltygear` : [Reddit comment visualizer](http://www.roadtolarissa.com/javascript/reddit-comment-visualizer/)

 "it isnâ€™t the writing hours that count, it is the rewriting hours. Everybody writes. People who are trying to walk the path towards mastery rewrite."
