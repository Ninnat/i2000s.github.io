# This Site

Why writing?

I write because I want to read, to repeat myself less, and to improve by rewriting. [^1] I imagine most things I write to be drafts in progress, toward something
I have yet to recognize. Blogging went back to my [current Wordpress blog](https://ninnatdangniam.wordpress.com/),
 my [previous Wordpress blog](https://truecrimson.wordpress.com/) and a now-defunct Windows Live Blog. 
 They are all parts of a [Long Content](http://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). 

Expect more from this section once there is more content.

 "it isnâ€™t the writing hours that count, it is the rewriting hours. Everybody writes. People who are trying to walk the path towards mastery rewrite."
