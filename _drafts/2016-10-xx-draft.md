title: Quantum field theory: A first pass
subtitle:
---
Quantum field theory (QFT) is notorious not only for its difficulty but also for its unreasonable effectiveness despite its apparently shaky foundations. I want to record and share my thought on the learning process from having recently completed a first one-semester course in QFT.

This is not a guide on how to get to QFT as quick as possible with as little prerequisites as possible; the classic guide *[From Griffiths to Peskin](https://fliptomato.wordpress.com/2006/12/30/from-griffiths-to-peskin-a-lit-review-for-beginners/)* already did that. This is also not a complete guide to QFT.

# What is second quantization?

A misnomer.

# Why quantized field?

What should this blog be about?

I've been blogging since 2005. At first it was all about hobbies and rants. Then it became a platform to record and share what I learned and found meaningful. That lasted until grad school and researches got the better of me in 2013. My [current Thai blog](https://ninnatdangniam.wordpress.com/) was created in May 2014 specifically to battle misunderstandings surrounding quantum computing. It didn't pick up steam until late 2015. [^1] Lately I also got myself into writing a piece on quantum computing for an editor in Thailand.

At some point it's not fun anymore when what you can write is decided by how much it grabs attention from a wider audience. (RSA is not safe! Gravitational waves! Nobel Prize!) So here we are, at my personal scratchpad.

Since this content of this blog is the product of my thinking, I should tell you where I'm coming from. The majority of people who know me at all knows me by the label "physics student", from which they infer various things about me.

I should begin at the beginning and introduce myself, or rather my thinking.

I happen to share two of my scientific heroes with my PhD advisor [Carlton Caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_M._Caves): [John Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler) and [Edwin Jaynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes). John Wheeler because he asks big questions, "why quantum theory?" being one of them. Edwin Jaynes because he sees clearly through the distinction between the map and the territory.

[^1]: If you want to see something of the same flavor in English, I heartily recommend the stuffs written by [Anastasia Marchenkova](http://amarchenkova.com/). When I saw her ["Top 3 Quantum Myths and Misconceptions"](http://amarchenkova.com/top-3-quantum-myths-and-misconceptions/), I swear I could have written it myself.

>Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of our language.
--- Ludwig Wittgenstein

Switching from biology to physics seems explicable from the outside perspective even though it feels natural from the inside. What is a good explanation.


>*One*, description first, explanation second --- that is, the "how" precedes the "why"; and

>*Two*, description is carried out in the language of mathematics; namely, equations.

>Ask not, said Galileo, whether an object falls because it is pulled from below or pushed from above.

>Ask how well you can predict the time it takes for the object to reavel a certain distance, and how that time will vary from object to object and as the angle of the track changes.

>Moreover, said Galileo, do not attempt to answer such questions in the qualitative and slippery nuances of human language; say it in the form of mathematical equations.

Magical thinking
