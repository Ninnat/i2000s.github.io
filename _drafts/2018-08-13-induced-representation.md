1. What is an adjoint functor? This will be answered by its *universal property* of being the "best" approximation to an inverse. This explains in what sense induction is an inverse to restriction of representations.
2. How to construct adjoints of the restriction functor? Before that, how is restriction a functor? It turns out that for our purpose, it is most convenient to think of the category of $G$-representations as the category of *$K[G]$-modules*.
3. How does the left and right adjoint give rise to induction and coinduction?

Universal property is the raison d'Ãªtre of many constructions across mathematics, which makes sense even if we forget all the "internal structure" of our mathematical objects and only focus on mappings between them.

/Introduce category
It turns out that this is the right level of abstraction.
