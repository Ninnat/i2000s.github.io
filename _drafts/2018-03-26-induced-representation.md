What is a linear representation? Is it the matrices $\rep(g)$ or the vector space on which the matrices act? The answer is both, and it is more natural to think of a linear representation as a module. A *module* over a ring $A$, also called *$A$-module*, is a generalization of a vector space over a field $K$.

We need to know the notion of an *adjoint functor*, and *extension of scalars* of a *module*. The notion of an induced representation generalizes the regular representation on $G$ to the regular representation on a coset space $G/K$.



The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics)#Examples) gives a pretty good list of examples
