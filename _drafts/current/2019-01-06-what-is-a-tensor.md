What is a tensor? A Google search gave me the definition according to [Oxford Living Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/tensor):

> A mathematical object analogous to but more general than a vector, represented by an array of components that are functions of the coordinates of a space.

This definition, a tensor as a multi-dimensional array, seems to be the most popular 

Never mind that the last part sounds more like a *tensor field* rather than a general tensor, a tensor as a multi-dimensional array seems to be the popular description. but for those who want to know more, this definition confuses *data type* (tensor) and *data structure* (array)

For a physics student, do you ever wonder what does a pseudoscalar like the determinant have anything to do with the tensor product?

Take an extreme example, the triple product $a \cdot (b \times c)$.

Actually, this is a segue to lure you into learning abstract linear algebra.

When physicists rave about how important tensors are, do often mean *tensor fields*
