# Research

I want to test all distinct connected graphs on, say $n \le 10$ vertices. [Their numbers](http://garsia.math.yorku.ca/~zabrocki/math3260w03/nall.html) grow very quickly.

A poor man's makeshift is to generate random graphs and hope that you get all the graphs with high probability. What is the probability of getting all $m$ graphs by randomly choosing $k \ge m$ times? (The probability is 0 if $k<m$) Well, there are $m^k$ total possibilities. If I fix $m$ slots for a non-repeating sequence, there are $m!$ such sequences. So the probability we want is
$m!/m^k$
times the number of ways to partition $k$ slots into $m$ non-empty subsets $S(k,m)$ called the [Stirling number of the second kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_numbers_of_the_second_kind). This problem is known as the [coupon collector's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem), and the number of random graphs we want to generate grows as $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$.

Note that the [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) asks for $1-$ the probability that there is *never* a repeating sequence.
- In Python, the [`igraph`](https://igraph.org/) module lets you generate a random graph (not necessarily connected) using [`Graph.Erdos_Renyi`](https://igraph.org/python/doc/igraph.GraphBase-class.html#Erdos_Renyi).
