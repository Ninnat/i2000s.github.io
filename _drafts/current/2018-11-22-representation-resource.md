Sometimes my physicist colleagues ask me about books on group and representation theory, and I hesitate to recommend the ones that I read the most.

I'm not a mathematician by trade, but when it comes to learning maths, I vastly prefer learning from books written by mathematicians. (Even better are books that strike a balance between mathematicians' maths and physicists' maths, but they are few and far between). For example, one of the quibbles I have with the way physicists teach group and representation theory is that they often conflate a group, its Lie algebra, and its representations together. That is, they sometimes write one thing but mean the other. One evidence in print that I can point to is Zee's *Group Theory in a Nutshell*:

> While I certainly understand the need to distinguish group and algebra, I find the constant shifting between upper and lower case letters rather fussy looking. Most physicists trust the context to make clear whether the group or the algebra is being discussed. Thus, I will follow the standard physics usage and write $\SU(2)$ for both group and algebra. An informal survey of physics students indicates that most agree with me.

Another quibble is that popular group theory books among physicists are usually written by high-energy physicists [^1], the side effects being the focus on unitary groups (using the correspondence between unitary groups and symmetric groups---the Schur-Weyl duality---without explanation) and the Lorentz group while giving little to no attention to the Heisenberg and symplectic groups [^2], which arguably are central to understand why *quantum mechanics* is the way it is.

Regardless, I will go ahead and recommend some books that are popular among math students, and some in the middle ground. (In fact, I've already done that in real life. This is just an online record.)

- Given a representation of $G$, is it decomposible? If yes, how to decompose it into irreducibles?
- Harmonic analysis. Decompose a regular representation over $G/K$.
- Branching
- Tensor product decomposition
- Invariants


[^1]: I have the same complain about quantum field theory textbooks. Quantum field theories don't have to be relativistic!

[^2]: In Zee's book, he dismisses the Heisenberg algebra as "not a Lie algebra", which is not true.
> I should mention that other types of algebras, notably the Heisenberg algebra that undergirds quantum mechanics, are also of interest to physicists, even though, since this is a textbook on group theory, I talk mostly about Lie algebras.
