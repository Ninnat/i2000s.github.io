Most of my researches in 2017-8 can be viewed as harmonic analysis on *generalized coherent states* or *generalized Gaussian states*.

**Category theory**
- [Category theory](https://jeremykun.com/category/category-theory/), Math $\cap$ programming

    There are only two universal properties: that of being initial and terminal. Commutative diagrams then are morphisms in a category of morphisms e.g. "[slice category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_category#Slice_category)".

- [Lectures](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/04/07/applied-category-theory-course-part-2/) by John Baez based on [7 Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf), Fong and Spivak

  A useful trick to understand anything in category theory is to first consider as a toy model a [*preorder*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preorder) [^1], a category with only one morphism $x\to y$, which can be though of as a comparison $x\le y$. For example, the product in this category is the infimum and the coproducts is the supremum. A functor between two preorders $A$ and $B$ is a *monotone function*, an order-preserving map
  $$ x \le_A y \implies f(x) \le_B f(b). $$
  A pair of monotone functions $f$ and $G$ is an *adjoint pair* if they satisfy the *Galois connection*:
  $$ f(a) \le_B b \iff a \le_A g(b). $$
  Suppose, for instance, that $A = B = \mathbb{N}$, the natural numbers. A monotone function $x \to 2x$ has no inverse but it does have right and left adjoints: the ceiling $\lceil x/2 \rceil$ and the floor $\lfloor x/2 \rfloor$. The notion of Galois connection generalizes to that of *adjunction*, an example of which is [*Frobenius reciprocity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_reciprocity) in representation theory.

- *Algebra: Chapter 0*, Paolo Aluffi (2009)

  An excellent abstract algebra book that incorporates category-theoretic thinking from the get-go, something that I've always looked for since my undergrad algebra professor had a similar approach. Too bad it chooses to explore homological algebra at the price of forgoing representation theory. The book does discuss modules but focuses on commutative ones. (Representations are generally non-commutative $K[G]$-modules.)

  > Essential factor behind the success of Wikipedia is the "community design" that is in the background, which provides incentives to content creators. Common lore is something like everyone can edit Wikipedia, and the encyclopedia is written by mostly random crowd of site visitors who click the edit button. That's complete nonsense. Wikipedia was written mostly by a dedicated community of volunteers with complex internal organization, hierarchies, social rewards, and the possibility of gaining power.

    >  Galpin investigated the percent of women in computer classes all around the world. Her number of 26% for the US is slightly higher than I usually hear, probably because it’s older (the percent women in computing has actually gone down over time!). The least sexist countries I can think of – Sweden, New Zealand, Canada, etc – all have somewhere around the same number (30%, 20%, and 24%, respectively). The most sexist countries do extremely well on this metric! The highest numbers on the chart are all from non-Western, non-First-World countries that do middling-to-poor on the Gender Development Index: Thailand with 55%, Guyana with 54%, Malaysia with 51%, Iran with 41%, Zimbabwe with 41%, and Mexico with 39%. Needless to say, Zimbabwe is not exactly famous for its deep commitment to gender equality [...] It’s a very common and well-replicated finding that the more progressive and gender-equal a country, the larger gender differences in personality of the sort Hyde found become.

    > One subgroup of women does not display these gender differences at any age. These are women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a condition that gives them a more typically-male hormone balance.

    > Meta-analyses have shown a very large (d = 1.18) difference in healthy men and women (ie without CAH) in this domain. It’s traditionally summarized as “men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people”. I would flesh out “things” to include both physical objects like machines as well as complex abstract systems; I’d also add in another finding from those same studies that men are more risk-taking and like danger. And I would flesh out “people” to include communities, talking, helping, children, and animals [...] Somebody armed with this theory could pretty well pretty well predict that women would be interested in going into medicine and law, since both of them involve people, talking, and helping. They would predict that women would dominate veterinary medicine (animals, helping), psychology (people, talking, helping, sometimes children), and education (people, children, helping). Of all the hard sciences, they might expect women to prefer biology (animals). And they might expect men to do best in engineering (objects, machines, abstract systems, sometimes danger) and computer science (machines, abstract systems).

    > Women are around 20% of CS majors, physics majors, engineering majors, etc – but almost half of math majors! [...] I was totally confused by this for a while until a commenter directed me to the data on what people actually do with math degrees. The answer is mostly: they become math teachers.

  > In our acquisition of knowledge of the Universe ( whether mathematical or otherwise) that which renovates the quest is nothing more nor less than complete innocence. It is in this state of complete innocence that we receive everything from the moment of our birth. Although so often the object of our contempt and of our private fears, it is always in us. It alone can unite humility with boldness so as to allow us to penetrate to the heart of things, or allow things to enter us and taken possession of us.

  > This unique power is in no way a privilege given to "exceptional talents" - persons of incredible brain power ( for example), who are better able to manipulate, with dexterity and ease, an enormous mass of data, ideas and specialized skills. Such gifts are undeniably valuable, and certainly worthy of envy from those who ( like myself) were not so endowed at birth," far beyond the ordinary".

  >Yet it is not these gifts, nor the most determined ambition combined with irresistible will-power, that enables one to surmount the "invisible yet formidable boundaries " that encircle our universe. Only innocence can surmount them, which mere knowledge doesn't even take into account, in those moments when we find ourselves able to listen to things, totally and intensely absorbed in child play.
