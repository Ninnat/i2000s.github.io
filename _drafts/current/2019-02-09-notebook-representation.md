# Recommended

- "Representation Theory", Ian Grojnowski in *The Princeton Companion to Mathematics*, Timothy Gowers (ed.) 2008
- "Lie groups and Lie algebras" and "Representations of simple Lie algebras" in *Moonshine Beyond the Monster*, Terry Gannon 2006

    Both are short and wonderful invitations from mathematical point of views, the former to the idea of representation theory and the latter to Lie groups and Lie algebras. Procesi's book below naturally built on the idea presented in Grojnowski's article.


- [Lie Groups and Representations: MATH G4343](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/LieGroups-2013/), Columbia University, Peter Woit

    Representation theory that every mathematical physicist should know? The lectures can be grouped into three parts:
    1. The basics (Lie groups, Lie algebras, exponential map, the standard semisimple theory of roots and weights, Peter-Weyl)
    2. The geometric highest weight theory (fiber bundles, induced representations, Borel subgroups, complex structure, and Borel-Weil)
    3. Physics (spinor and metaplectic representation, Hamlitonian mechanics, moment map)

    Despite me calling the last part "physics", the geometric highest weight theory is also important to understand generalized coherent states and quantizations in physics.


- *An Introduction to Lie Groups and Lie Algebras*, Alexander Kirillov Jr. (A concise introduction to the standard semisimple theory and no more. Great when I just started out and didn't know where to focus)
- *Lie Groups Beyond an Introduction*, 2nd ed., Anthony W. Knapp (A very well-written, well-organized, and thorough reference but at 800+ pages, it is too overwhelming to be an introduction, hence the title.)
  - [Structure theory of semisimple Lie groups](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~aknapp/pdf-files/1-27.pdf), Knapp 1997 (A short summary of the standard semisimple theory and the more advanced structure theory in his book above.)
- *Representation Theory: A First Course*, Fulton and Harris (Erratic learning curve: lots of examples of representations of classical Lie algebras, but some explanations are hand-wavings and the authors don't hesitate to drop on you facts from different branches of maths like differential and algebraic geometry.  Mostly about Lie algebras, but has an eclectic selection of topics about real and complex Lie groups and homogeneous spaces in a couple of chapters.)
- *Theory of Group Representations and Applications*, Barut and RÄ…czka
- *Lie Groups: An Approach through Invariants and Representations*, Claudio Procesi
- *Symmetry, Representations, and Invariants*, Goodman and Wallach
- "Perspectives on Invariant Theory: Schur Duality, Multiplicity-Free Actions and Beyond" in *The Schur Lectures*, Roger Howe 1992
