## Preview without proof

The Lie algebra of every compact connected Lie group is a direct sum of a semisimple commutator subalgebra and an abelian center
$$\begin{align}
  \g = [\g,\g] \oplus Z_{\g}
\end{align}$$
The semisimple part, being equal to its own commutator, consists of traceless operators and the center consists of multiples of identity. In physicists' term, $Z_{\g}$ is the part of Hamiltonians in $\g$ that only shifts the zero of the energy and can be ignored.
