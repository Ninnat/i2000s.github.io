> One day sixty-six million years ago, life on Earth almost came to a shattering end. The world that emerged after the impact was a much simpler place. When sunlight finally broke through the haze, it illuminated a hellish landscape. The oceans were empty. The land was covered with drifting ash. The forests were charred stumps. The cold gave way to extreme heat as a greenhouse effect kicked in. Life mostly consisted of mats of algae and growths of fungus: for years after the impact, the Earth was covered with little other than ferns. Furtive, ratlike mammals lived in the gloomy understory. But eventually life emerged and blossomed again, in new forms.

tl;dr version:

- In the 70's, Walter (geologist) and Luis Alvarez (nuclear physicist) discovered a KT layer laced with iridium, conjectured to be from the asteroid impact. The impact crater (named Chicxulub) was found in 1991. The debate was considered largely settled [in 2010](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5970/1214) (wow!) that the asteroid caused the extinction.

- "3 metre problem": almost no dinosaur remains have before been found 3 metres below the so-called "KT boundary", a layer of sediment that preserves the asteroid's debris and ash from the extinction event.

- [The new paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/27/1817407116) is a result from the discovery dated back to 2012 by a grad student Robert DePalma of the KT site "Tanis" (a Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark reference) at Hell Creek in North Dakota. They even found preserved microtektites, a sort of glass beads or spindles that formed from molten rock ejected during the impact and solidified when re-entering the atmosphere. This suggests that the site recorded the first hours or so of the extinction event.

- Physics problem: there was not enough time for the flood that would preserve the microtektites to reach the site from the source of impact. They conjectured that the flood was caused by seiches that can happen far away from the source, and estimated the time all kinds of different seismic waves would arrive at the site to cause such seiches (6, 10, and 13 minutes).

<!--    I strongly feel that this season of Mob Psycho is better than the first, if only because the first needs to setup the foundations and everything. But I think that in the backdrop of many fantastic moments (Mob joinging the Body Improvement Club, Mob seeing Ritsu's psychic power for the first time, or Reigen's 1000%), the major plot thread of Season 1 is still pretty tropy (monster of the week -> protag with power meets another one with the same power (Teruki) -> fighting evil organization), even though it is tropy just so that it can be subverted. Season 2 is also full-blown coming-of-age story. Bones treats us to many amazing fight animations that make people at Sakugabooru occupied for a while. However, someone who, say, disappointed that Mogami is more powerful a foe than Touichiro because Mob didn't go ???% totally misses the point; the fact that Mob defeated Touichiro is a sure thing, but the point is that Mob won the fight against himself, against his emotions going out of control, againsts losing his self (which is literally what happens during the ???%). In the end, this is a story of a boy who comes to understand, improve, and accept his emotions, and by expressing his, lifts up others as well. -->
