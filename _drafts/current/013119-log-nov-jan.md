> Thus we have three geometries on $\mathbb{R}^2$: Euclidean, similarity and affine geometries. Those geometries have their own invariants, which is certain information that is not changed by the allowed transformations. In Euclidean geometry, there are many invariants: length, angles, perpendicular, etc. In similarity geometry, we lose length as an invariant, but the angle of two lines is still a valid invariant. In affine geometry, we lose angles, but we do retain some basic invariants such as parallel lines, and ratios of length. We can go on and equip $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the very general group of homeomorphisms. This geometry is known as topology. There are very few invariants here, but the dimension of a figure is still a well-defined geometry. Topology is sometimes known as the largest interesting geometry.

## 2.2 Meditation

> The problem is that with meditation, you can't do a double-blind study: One man's "faux meditation" is another man's carefully designed meditation practice. The NSR teaching method promoted on [/r/nondirective](https://www.reddit.com/r/nondirective/) as a substitute for Transcendental Meditation was originally used as an active control in 1976: [Psychotherapeutic effects of transcendental meditation with controls for expectation of relief and daily sitting](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-006X.44.4.630). In that study, it was assumed to be "faux" meditation. It was also used as the Bensons' Relaxation Response (low mindfulness relaxation) variant in [Alexander 1989](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2693686). In that study, it was assumed to be "real" meditation.
