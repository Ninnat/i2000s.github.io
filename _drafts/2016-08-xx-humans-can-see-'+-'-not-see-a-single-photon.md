title: Psychophysics, psychics and photons all begin with p

Meaning is not always best given by definition.

P value is not the probability of the hypothesis given the data. I have heard enough of that.

P value is easily misinterpreted even by experts. I have also heard enough of that.

What I want to hear emphasized on more is that a single p value doesn't mean anything, including when it comes to replicability. And when all other summaries of the data are employed, p value doesn't have any value left.

# 1. Can humans see a single photon?

An experiment recently published in Nature Communication found that [humans can see a single photon significantly better than by chance](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160719/ncomms12172/full/ncomms12172.html)
The story makes the rounds on the internet. See [here](http://www.nature.com/news/people-can-sense-single-photons-1.20282), [here](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-human-eye-photon-20160719-snap-story.html)
and [here](http://petapixel.com/2016/07/25/human-eye-sensitive-can-detect-single-photon-light/).

A single photon is a state of monochromatic light with the smallest and definite amount of energy. To be sure, [the retina can sense a single photon](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Quantum/see_a_photon.html)
[^1] but we may not consciously notice it. If we don't, it's for a good reason since we could be overwhelmed by random flickerings in the dark.
Now the conclusion of the new study may well be true, but I find this part worrisome:

> During data acquisition, each subject went through up to 20 sessions. Still this high amount of sessions was not enough to obtain statistically significant performance
 for individual subjects, and therefore we pooled the data together to increase significance (Fig. 2aâ€“d).

This looks like a p-value fishing to me (intentional or not).

Statistical power: p conflates effect size and sample size

As [this spoof article](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-12-01/correlation-or-causation) reminds us, [correlation does not imply causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation).
 But even worse is that correlation does not imply true correlation.

Diphoton bump. Chasing the rainbow. Naturalness.

[^1]: Within a range of frequencies. For instance, [we don't see infrared photons even though our body emits them all the time](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2012/05/25/quantum-mechanics-when-you-close-your-eyes/).
