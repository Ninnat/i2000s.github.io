The quantum field theory course just ended, and it is probably my last course ever that I take as a student. We covered roughly the first part of [Peskin and Schroeder](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Student-Economy-Frontiers/dp/0813350190): quantization of free scalar and Dirac fields, perturbative calculations (Feynman diagrams) of cross sections and decay rates, QED, and perturbative renormalizaton. No path integrals or non-perturbative, Wilsonian picture of renormalization. Each student got a chance to delve deeper into his topic of interest by writing a term paper and presenting it, the opportunity I took to learn about gauge theory and topological quantum field theory.

What is quantum field theory?

The whole business of qft is to give a sensible continuum limit to quantum mechanics.
