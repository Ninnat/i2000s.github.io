I have a recurring mathematical nightmare.  I'm reading a paper with several difficult concepts, trying to grasp their meaning.  But just as I am about to understand one, *the page turns, on its own*.  When I try to turn it back, I can't!  So I go on to the next lemma, but it uses notation defined on a previous page.  Again I try to go back, but the page is stuck.  Then it turns again, and I find that the main theorem relies on a definition from the introduction whose details I have forgotten -- and which I can no longer turn back to.

Okay, this isn't actually a nightmare -- it's how I feel at many seminars.

## The Beamer trap
I think the prevalence of such bad talks is mainly due to one thing: widespread use of Beamer.  Now,
 Beamer is great if your presentation consists mostly of **bulleted text**, **equations**, and **theorems**.

But Beamer falls down when it comes to layout, for one simple reason: Latex is aimed to lay out mathematical texts, not visual aids.  In other words, Latex is a tool for making documents that people will **read**.  And that's what usually happens when you give a Beamer presentation: people **read** your presentation.  They don't listen to you.

At least, they *try* to read your presentation.  But they are readers who can't choose to turn the page, and must proceed at your pace!  Since many Beamer talks are indeed written like papers -- chock full of notation, definitions, and lemmas --  this is a fatal handicap.

In short, Beamer invites you to transmogrify your paper into a talk.  Resist the temptation.

## What should you do instead?

In a seminar, you have communication tools that can't be used in a paper.  Use them: graphics, animations, and the spoken word.  As you do so, you may find that Beamer isn't always the best tool for writing your talks.

Simplify.  Explain the general case and leave out the highly technical assumptions that are only needed to deal with pathological cases.  Make pictures that give your audience the gist of the main result, even if imprecisely.  Use analogies and examples.  Wave your hands.

Let me conclude with some [advice from John Baez](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/advice.html) (with my emphasis added):

>...see how silly you look staring at the overhead projector, blocking the view for the audience with your own shadow, **mumbling "omega squared phi times psi cubed d theta" like some mad scientist when you could actually be looking at the audience and telling them something cool**. Watch yourself struggling to turn on the laser pointer, tripping over the microphone wire, fumbling around for the next transparency, struggling to slowly slide a piece of paper down the transparency in a pathetic intellectual striptease, desperately struggling against Microsoft to get your Powerpoint presentation to work, engaging in all sorts of pointless antics that distract from the subject matter, wasting precious time, boring people to death. And resolve to do better!

>You are on stage: be entertaining! **Don't show people equations they don't really need to see - that's what journal articles are for**. Convey your wisdom in memorable sentences. Be eloquent.
