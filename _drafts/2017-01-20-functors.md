I've been thinking about induced representations and the Frobenius reciprocity theorem which have a natural interpretation in terms of adjoint functor in category theory. So this post is not going to be an introduction to category theory per se. You can find better introductions out there written by a real practitioner such as this [3-parter](https://topologicalmusings.wordpress.com/category/math-topics/category-theory/category-theory-for-beginners/) by Todd Trimble.

<!-- This post also benefits from a discussion with Jacob Miller, but any mistake here should be attributed to me alone.-->

My first contact with category theory was the book [*Mathematical Physics*](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Physics-Chicago-Lectures/dp/0226288625) by Robert Geroch. There, category theory is seen to provide organizing principles to view seemingly unrelated constructions across many areas of mathematical physics. Ditto for mathematics. To me, one of the most powerful lesson from category theory is that knowing the relations between an object with other objects is as good as knowing the object itself, as the object can be defined by these relations. Occasionally, there is an object that has a "universal" property that can simulate the relations to all other objects of the same kind and so can be thought of as the "best" object of its kind. And if it exists, most of the time it is also unique up to a "natural" isomorphism. As a bonus, all of these can be represented by diagrams of objects and arrows. I will give some examples of these on the way but let us first define what categories are.

A category $\mathcal{C}$ is a class of objects and morphisms between them. If $X$ and $Y$ are objects in $\mathcal{C}$, the class of morphisms between $X$ and $Y$ is denoted by Hom$(X,Y)$. They are also represented diagrammatically as arrows $f:X \to Y$ for $f \in \text{Hom}(X,Y)$. For $\mathcal{C}$ to be a category, there must be a unit (identity) morphism and the compositions of morphisms must be associative. Here are some categories.
- **Set** of all sets. Since there is no [set of all sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox), the word "class" in the definition of a category cannot be replaced by "set". The morphisms are arbitrary maps between sets.
- **Grp** of all groups, **Ring** of all rings, and **Field**$_p$ of all fields with [characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_rings#Category_of_fields) $p=0$ or a prime number with the respective homomorphisms as morphisms.
- **Top** of topological spaces with continuous maps as morphisms. In particular, homeomorphisms are isomorphisms.
- **Man**$^{\infty}$ of smooth manifolds with infinitely differentiable maps as morphisms. In particular, diffeomorphisms are isomorphisms.
- **Vec**$_k$ of vector spaces over a field $k$ with linear maps as morphisms.

These are all examples of "large" categories. We can also have a "small" category with one object, morphisms being operations between elements of that object (so that it is a [monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid), with the "doing nothing" operation as the identity). [^1]

My favorite elementary example of uniquely defining an object by morphisms is the construction of [a product and a coproduct](https://topologicalmusings.wordpress.com/2008/06/22/basic-category-theory-i/) of two objects. A product is defined

Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are two categories and $X,Y \in \mathcal{C}$. A (covariant) functor $F$ is a map (of both objects and morphisms) $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ such that $\text{Hom}(X,Y) \to \text{Hom}(F(X) , F(Y))$ preserves identity morphisms and compositions.

- One of the most trivial kinds of functors are ones that only throw away information. The forgetful functor **Grp** $\to$ **Set** is a functor that sends a group to its underlying set.
- The free functor $F$ **Set** $\to$ **Grp** sends a set to the "free group". For example, if $S = \{a,b\}$ is the set, then $F(S)$ is the set of all expressions ("words") that can be composed from elements of $S$: $\{a,a^{-1},a^2,a^3, \dots, b,b^{-1},\dots ,ab,ba,\dots \}$. It is the least constrained group that can be built from elements of $S$ as generators. The categorical way to say that is that the free functor has the universal property that any map $A$ from $S$ to some group $G$ factors through the free group $F(S)$ with the unique $B$.

- The forgetful functor $F:$ **Vec**$_k \to k$ sends a vector space to its underlying field. The free functor $F: k \to$ **Vec** in this case is less interesting because every vector space is free.
- Sometimes a functor makes compositions "go in the wrong direction". Examples of these "contravariant" functors are taking the adjoint of linear operators and the pullback of maps between smooth manifolds.

Every group can be specified as a set of [generators and relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_of_a_group). So we can get to every object in **Set** by the forgetful functor from **Grp** and every object in **Grp** through the free functor from **Set**. Thus, the forgetful functor and the free functor are in some sense inverses to each other even though **Set** and **Grp** are clearly not the same. This concept of a generalized inverse is formalized in the notion of an adjoint functor.

# Adjoint functors

Functors $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ and $G: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}$ are adjoint functors if for any $X \in \mathcal{C}$ and $Y \in \mathcal{D}$, there is an isomorphism
$$ \begin{align}
\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}} (F(X),Y) \simeq \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}} (X,F(Y)).
$$ \end{align}
Then $F$ is a left adjoint of $G$ and $G$ is a right adjoint of $F$. (This is the definition via [Hom-set adjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_functors#Hom-set_adjunction).)

Why should this be true in the case of the forgetful functor $E$ and the free functor $F$ between **Grp** and **Set**? A group homomorphism $\varphi :F(S) \to G$ is completely determined if we know what it does to each element of $S$. In other words, what $\varphi$ really acts on is the underlying set of $G$. That is, giving $\varphi$ is equivalent to giving $\psi : S \to E(G)$.
$$ \begin{align}
\text{Hom}_{\text{\bf Grp}} (F(S),G) \simeq \text{Hom}_{\text{\bf Set}} (S,E(G))
$$ \end{align}
so that the free functor is a left adjoint of the forgetful functor.

There is a cute way to make the analogy between adjoint functors and the actual adjoints of linear maps more precise. (This is my take on the correspondence in [Etingof](http://math.mit.edu/~etingof/replect.pdf), with some inspiration drawn from [Baez](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/quantum/node3.html).) Think of a single vector space $V$ over a field $k$ with a fixed nondegenerate bilinear form $\langle , \rangle$ (which may not be symmetric, unlike an inner product) as a category by itself, with vectors $x,y \in V$ as objects and linear maps $L:V \to W$ as functors.

An adjoint $L^*$ of $L$ is defined implicitly by
$$ \begin{align}
    \langle L^* y,x \rangle = \langle y, Lx \rangle
\end{align} $$
For each and every vector $x \in V$ there is a unique linear functor sending $1 \in k$ to $x$. So the inner product $\langle x,y \rangle$ can be thought of as a morphism from $k$ to $k$. The trick is that

Normally vector additions and scalings would be the morphisms.



[^1]: "Monoid" is what physicists usually mean when they say "semigroup" because a semigroup doesn't need to have an identity element.
