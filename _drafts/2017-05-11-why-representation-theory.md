From my experience, representation theory is a math topic that every physic student feels like they should learn but few actually do. And I think the reason is that representation theory is such a vast subject that it is hard to know where to focus. I will describe in this post what I have learned so far and the glue that connect disparate topics together.

## Example of matrix Lie groups

## Complex semisimple Lie algebras
