Why writing? One possible goal is, as [John Baez](http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html)) put it succinctly,

>My goal is to make myself obsolete.

I remember reading about a conversation with Paul Dirac (which I can't find the source anymore, probably a library book). Dirac was asked about his achievement in theoretical physics, to which Dirac replied that he didn't achieve much and proceeded to change the subject away from himself and to physics. So in a way, he got to talk about his achievement, his thinking in physics, without talking about himself.

I figure to start this blog I should first introduce myself but without much [tribal affiliation](http://www.gwern.net/Links#profile). You won't find out where I was born and raised or how famous (or not) were the schools I went to. They are not so much secrets; you can find those out in no time if you want to. But neither they are important. I want to talk about physics and math, and how you might be able to learn it too.

How one person learns differs from another and could depend on the entirety of the person's experience and the character. In the 1980's, a consensus began to form in the field of personality psychology that humans have 5 major independent (weakly correlated) traits called [Big Five](http://pages.uoregon.edu/sanjay/bigfive.html). My Big Five scores (tested on [this page](http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/) that the webpage by Sanjay points to) are
- Openness to Experience: medium-high, 65th - 70th percentile
- Conscientiousness: medium
- Extraversion: very low, 1st - 3rd percentile
- Agreeableness: medium-high
- Neuroticism: low
These traits are supposed to be pretty stable, but I think that meditation has lowered my neuroticism significantly. [^1] I didn't know about this categorization of mental constitutions before I started meditate or doing physics and math, but in hindsight, they can explain several of my quirks. I didn't know that I like physics and math. In fact, all the socially conceived signs pointed to the opposite. I did not persevere in solving logic puzzles. I didn't like math competitions. I hated studying for physics and math in high school. But according to Sarah Constantin, I probably [like Bach](http://celandine13.livejournal.com/47993.html). And also illustrations, mythology, speculations, math, computer science, meditation. (I already liked the first three.) I have an impulse towards the intricate and bizarre.

It was actually a physics professor that identified me as such. High school physics and math are like the first half of college freshman physics and math: a tedious and difficult slog that prepares you for the actually interesting second half. Except that you're never told about the second half! Openness to experience means that I constantly seek out new, meaningful ideas. Introversion means that statuses (grades, fame) don't really motivate me. (Stress from competitions also outweighs them.) These together with the not-so-high conscientiousness means that I easily give up doing difficult but meaningless things (but feel guilty when others are upset that I deliberately ignore the work given to me, possibly because of my agreeableness). I ended up spending a lot of my time, as Sarah calls it, short-circuited my curiosity with "low quality" stimulants like gaming. [^2] Biology was what I did best in my high school, and evolution and neuroscience are really really interesting. Sure, there was a lot of things to memorize, but since I enjoyed reading so much it didn't feel like rote memorization at all. So I went on to study biology in college. Not before long, however, I was fed up with sloppy thinking, distrust in reductionist, mathematical models that can correct for some of such sloppy thinking [^3] [^4], and the dislike and unwillingness to learn other disciplines in general [^5]. (Conservativeness is the opposite of openness to experience!) I talked with physics professors about this and one of them told me that people like me find *beauty* in the reduction of intricate set of phenomena to a handful of simple rules. It was a big revelation, first because somebody I barely knew could describe me more accurately than I myself could, and second because it was the first time I was assured that aesthetics has a place in science and math. It may not be a criterion of truth, but it is a criterion to find out what I might want to do! It was also a sign that the physics community has something in it for me.

Knowing my own personality, the learning strategy is simple; get curious. Look for paradoxes in need of explanations. Searching for concise, to-the-point lecture notes to learn the overarching principles. Working out problems. Take a class if possible, then relearn the subject in the way I wish to understand it. It is normal to have to relearn multiple times to master the subject. (What I wish I appreciate sooner is writing notes *completely* in your own words --- emphasis on the word "completely". It is actually quite hard to do unless I have a large enough pool of different perspectives to draw from. But I think attempting to get to that point as soon as possible is worth the effort.) Incorporate [spaced repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition), the effect of which can be visualized [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai2K3qHpC7c#t=2m40s).

There are five main subjects in any undergrad physics curriculum:
- Classical mechanics
- Electromagnetism
- Thermodynamics and statistical physics
- Quantum mechanics
- Special relativity
I enjoy organic and biochemistry a lot. So a natural step that built on them would be physical chemistry, which is mostly nothing but statistical physics and quantum mechanics. I was also intensely interested in the foundational side of quantum theory (which I initially called the "philosophical" side but [Matt Leifer's blog](http://mattleifer.info/) managed to correct me on that) including quantum field theory.

## Quantum theory

Griffiths.


1. Calculus. **What I didn't get the first time:** I was in a state of confusion the whole time. It turned out to be less of a confusion but the unwillingness to get used to math for the sake of getting used to math. It immediately clicked once I knew I needed calculus to learn physics.

Here are some examples of non-textbook stuffs I enjoy or expect to enjoy: (See also [this](http://celandine13.livejournal.com/47993.html) and [this](http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com/2012/09/trying-to-see-through-unified-theory-of.html).)

# English

If like me, English is not your mother tongue, then it is extremely important to be able to read English well. This was how I found out about real physics and math outside of classrooms. Better yet, fluency in the language means that you can seek high-quality education no matter where you are from.

I prefer American system over British system.

 [^1]: By meditation, I don't mean something like a serious, [10-day-retreat](http://www.suanmokkh-idh.org/) [vipassana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81) (insight) meditation. Briefly, meditation stops me from subconsciously labeling everything as "good" or "bad", thus realizing viscerally Hamlet's dictum: "There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."

 [^2]: I don't mean that gaming is "low" or untasteful. I mean that the scope of science and math, which includes games, is much more vast. From G.H. Hardy, *A Mathematician's Apology*:
 >A chess problem is genuine mathematics, but it is in some way "trivial" mathematics. However, ingenious and intricate, however original and surprising the moves, there is something essential lacking. Chess problems are unimportant. The best mathematics is serious as well as beautiful-"important" if you like, but the word is very ambiguous, and "serious" expresses what I mean much better.

 [^3]: Quoting a passage from this Los Angeles Times piece on [Processor Tom Tombrello physics class at Caltech](http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-16/local/me-51041_1_correct-answers/2),

>In one of last year's screening questions, students looked at an imaginary world based on Tombrello's wording of a 1940s song. He used: "Mares eat oats and does eat oaks and little lambs eat ivy." The question: Assume a small, equal number of each type of animal and type of vegetation; assuming that all compete for space, describe the evolution of the ecosystem.

>One student came up with "The Oak Catastrophe" theory. Say the oaks dropped acorns with a long germination period. Meanwhile, the animals eat up all the food. Then, there's nothing to eat, so they die too. But the acorns are time bombs. They grow, and there is nothing to eat them. And they become so big that their shade kills any other plants that grow.

>Clever, Tombrello said, but the student made one big mistake: She did not back up her theory with math. She did not get in.

Not in my biology classes. Anyone can bullshit like this and get away with it.
