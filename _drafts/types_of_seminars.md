## Know your audience: the seminar continuum
As scientists, we are called on to speak to different kinds of audiences.  Depending on your audience, you should adjust the focus of your talk.  Here's a dramatic oversimplification that is still useful:

![The seminar continuum][1]

I call it the **seminar continuum**.  Here's what it means.  Virtually any talk you give should include at least something from each part of the pyramid on the left.  You should almost always start with some very general motivation that people outside your field can relate to, and you almost always want to at least say something about some recent achievement of your own.  What changes is how much time to spend on each part.  Typically, you should spend the most time on the part of the pyramid (on the right) that lies at the level corresponding to your audience (on the left).

This means that if you're giving a **small seminar** to a few specialists in your area, you can spend little or no time on motivation, since that will be very familiar to them already.  You should spend almost all of your time describing some fascinating development in your latest paper -- that's what they came to hear, and they can understand it.  This kind of talk is often appropriate at specialized conferences, or at large conferences where your talk is one among many that run in parallel.

If you're like me, you give quite a few talks of the type just mentioned.  The other type of talk you probably give quite often is what I'll call the **department colloquium**.  Here your audience consists of faculty and graduate students (and maybe senior undergrads) from your own discipline.  Unlike the small seminar audience, most of them don't work in your subfield.  Thus you should spend more time on motivation, and on bridging from general motivation for your field/subfield to the specific motivation for your own work.  This also gives you the opportunity to mention related work by the specialists who may be in the audience.  The audience won't be so interested in the grittiest details of your work; thus you'll probably want to focus more on results than techniques, and paint your research contributions in fairly broad strokes.  This kind of talk is also especially important since it's the kind you'll give when interviewing for a job.  It's also often appropriate for a plenary talk at an international conference.



## A note to students
As a student, you will almost always want to focus most of your time on the top level of the pyramid, for two reasons.  First,
