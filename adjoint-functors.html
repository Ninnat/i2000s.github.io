<!-- Lately I've been thinking about induced representations and the Frobenius reciprocity which have a natural interpretation in terms of adjoint functor in category theory. This post is an introduction to the categorical point of view that I need at the level I'm comfortable with. (You can find better general introductions out there by mathematicians such as [this 3-parter](https://topologicalmusings.wordpress.com/category/math-topics/category-theory/category-theory-for-beginners/) by Todd Trimble.)
-->

<p><strong>I.</strong></p>
<p>one of the most powerful lessons from category theory is that knowing the relations between an object with other objects is as good as knowing the object itself, as the object can be defined by these relations. A lot of time there is a unique (up to a natural isomorphism which doesn’t entail making any arbitrary choice) object that has a “universal” property that can simulate the relations to all other objects of the same kind and so can be thought of as the “best” object of its kind. All of these can be represented graphically by objects and arrows. I will give some examples of these on the way but let us first define what categories are.</p>
<h2 id="categories">Categories</h2>
<p>A <strong>category</strong> <span class="math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is a class of objects and morphisms between them. If <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> are <strong>objects</strong> in <span class="math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, the class of <strong>morphisms</strong> between <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> is denoted by <span class="math">\(\text{Hom}(X,Y)\)</span>. They are also represented diagrammatically as arrows <span class="math">\(f:X \to Y\)</span> for <span class="math">\(f \in \text{Hom}(X,Y)\)</span>. For <span class="math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> to be a category, there must be a identity morphism and the compositions of morphisms must be associative. Here are some categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set</strong> of all sets. Since there is no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox">set of all sets</a>, the word “class” in the definition of a category cannot be replaced by “set”. The morphisms are arbitrary maps between sets.</li>
<li><strong>Grp</strong> of all groups, <strong>Ring</strong> of all rings, and <strong>Field</strong><span class="math">\(_p\)</span> of all fields with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_rings#Category_of_fields">characteristic</a> <span class="math">\(p=0\)</span> or a prime number with the respective homomorphisms as morphisms. (There is no homomorphism between fields of different characteristics.)</li>
<li><strong>Top</strong> of topological spaces with continuous maps as morphisms. In particular, homeomorphisms are isomorphisms.</li>
<li><strong>Man</strong><span class="math">\(^{\infty}\)</span> of smooth manifolds with infinitely differentiable maps as morphisms. In particular, diffeomorphisms are isomorphisms.</li>
<li><strong>Vec</strong><span class="math">\(_k\)</span> of vector spaces over a field <span class="math">\(k\)</span> with linear maps as morphisms.</li>
</ul>
My favorite elementary example of uniquely defining an object by morphisms is the construction of a product and a coproduct. A <strong>product</strong> of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is an object <span class="math">\(C\)</span> together with a morphism from <span class="math">\(C\)</span> to <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> such that, if <span class="math">\(D\)</span> is another object also equipped with some morphisms to <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, then there is a unique morphism from <span class="math">\(D\)</span> to <span class="math">\(C\)</span> such that the following diagram “commutes” (so we call this kind of diagrams commutative diagrams), meaning that every way to compose such morphisms to go from <span class="math">\(D\)</span> to <span class="math">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math">\(B\)</span> gives the same result.

<!-- \begin{align*}
    \xymatrix{
      & D \ar[dl]_{\alpha'}\ar[d]^{\gamma}\ar[dr]^{\beta'} & \\
      A & C\ar[l]^{\alpha}\ar[r]_{\beta} & B
    }
\end{align*} -->
<p>The rational behind this definition is that <span class="math">\(C\)</span> together with the mappings <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_property">best</a> object that acts as a product of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> since giving any morphism from any object <span class="math">\(D\)</span> to <span class="math">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is equivalent to giving <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> from <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, so we can just forget about <span class="math">\(D\)</span> altogether and regard <span class="math">\(C\)</span> as a universal simulator of such relations.</p>
The same diagram with all arrows reversed defines a <strong>coproduct</strong> <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.

      A\ar[ur]^{\alpha'}\ar[r]_{\alpha} & C\ar[u]_{\gamma} & B\ar[l]^{\beta}\ar[ul]_{\beta'}
    }
\end{align*} -->
<p>In <strong>Set</strong>, the product is the direct product <span class="math">\(A \times B\)</span> and the coproduct is the disjoint union <span class="math">\(A \amalg B\)</span>. We will just verify the first statement to familiarize ourselves with the meaning of the diagrams. For the direct product <span class="math">\(C=A \times B\)</span>, a natural choice for the mappings <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is the projection <span class="math">\[ \begin{aligned}
\alpha(a,b) = a, &amp;&amp; \beta(a,b) = b.
\end{aligned} \]</span> We have to show that, for any <span class="math">\(\alpha&#39;\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta&#39;\)</span> from a set <span class="math">\(D\)</span>, there is a morphism <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> from <span class="math">\(D\)</span> to <span class="math">\(C\)</span> that makes the diagram commutes and uniquely so. Obviously, for <span class="math">\(d\in D\)</span>, this map is <span class="math">\[ \begin{aligned}
\gamma(d) = (\alpha&#39;(d),\beta&#39;(d)),
\end{aligned} \]</span> If there is another map <span class="math">\(\gamma&#39;\)</span> from <span class="math">\(D\)</span> to <span class="math">\(C\)</span> that makes the diagram commutes, it must sends <span class="math">\(d\)</span> to an element of <span class="math">\(A \times B\)</span> that projects to <span class="math">\(\alpha&#39;(d)\)</span> on <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta&#39;(d)\)</span> on <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. But that element is none other than <span class="math">\((\alpha&#39;(d),\beta&#39;(d))\)</span>. Thus, the uniqueness is established. For the disjoint union <span class="math">\(C = A \amalg B\)</span>, a natural choice for the mappings <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is the embedding of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> into the union. Then the proof proceeds in the same manner by making obvious choices and following the arrows around (“diagram chasing”).</p>
We can ask if the direct product and the direct sum of sets are the only product and coproduct objects in <strong>Set</strong>. The nice answer is that they are. And this is not only true in <strong>Set</strong> but also in a general category as well. Let us show this for the categorical product in <strong>Set</strong>. Suppose that we have two product objects <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C&#39;\)</span>. Then there are unique morphisms in both directions, <span class="math">\(\gamma: C&#39; \to C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\gamma&#39;:C \to C&#39;\)</span>, that make the diagram commutes.

    }
\end{align*}
-->
<p>Surely <span class="math">\(\alpha \circ \gamma \circ \gamma&#39; = \alpha&#39; \circ \gamma&#39; = \alpha\)</span>. and <span class="math">\(\beta \circ \gamma \circ \gamma&#39; = \beta&#39; \circ \gamma&#39; = \beta\)</span>. But these mean that if we replace <span class="math">\(C&#39;\)</span> in the diagram by <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\gamma \circ \gamma&#39;\)</span> is a unique morphism from <span class="math">\(C\)</span> to itself that makes the new diagram commutes. But we know that the identity morphism also makes the diagram commutes, so <span class="math">\(\gamma \circ \gamma&#39;\)</span> has to be the identity morphism.</p>
<p>Maybe you don’t enjoy this abstract notion of product as I do. Why going so far to define something that should reduce to the notion of a product in any category? Well, it is not always clear what the notion of a product should be. <a href="https://topologicalmusings.wordpress.com/2008/06/22/basic-category-theory-i/">Todd Trimble</a> gives an example in the case of the category <strong>Top</strong> of all topological spaces.</p>
<h2 id="functors">Functors</h2>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> are two categories and <span class="math">\(X,Y \in \mathcal{C}\)</span>. A (covariant) <strong>functor</strong> <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is a map (of both objects and morphisms) <span class="math">\(F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\text{Hom}(X,Y) \to \text{Hom}(F(X) , F(Y))\)</span> preserves identity morphisms and compositions.</p>
<p>One of the more trivial kinds of functors are ones that simply throw away information. The <strong>forgetful functor</strong> <strong>Grp</strong> <span class="math">\(\to\)</span> <strong>Set</strong> sends a group to its underlying set; it completely forgets the group structure. There are also functors that are partially forgetful such as the functor from <strong>Grp</strong> to <strong>Ab</strong> the category of all abelian groups which set <span class="math">\(gh=hg\)</span> for all elements <span class="math">\(g,h\)</span> in a group.</p>
More interesting is the <strong>free functor</strong> <span class="math">\(F:\)</span> <strong>Set</strong> <span class="math">\(\to\)</span> <strong>Grp</strong> sending a set to its “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_group">free group</a>”. For a set <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, <span class="math">\(F(S)\)</span> is the set of all expressions that can be composed from elements of <span class="math">\(S\)</span>: every power and inverse of each and every element and (noncommutative) products of them; it is the least constrained group that can be built from elements of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> as generators. The categorical way to say this is that the free functor has the universal property that giving a map <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> from <span class="math">\(S\)</span> to some group <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is equivalent to giving a unique group homomorphism <span class="math">\(\varphi\)</span> from the free group <span class="math">\(F(S)\)</span> to <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. (The empty set gives the trivial group.)

<!-- \begin{align}
    \xymatrix{
      S \ar[r]\ar[dr]_{\sigma} & F(S) \ar[d]^{\varphi} \\
      & G
    }
\end{align} -->

<p>The free functor sends an object in <strong>Set</strong> to an object in <strong>Grp</strong>, and the forgetful functor sends an object in <strong>Grp</strong> to an object in <strong>Set</strong>. But their composition is not the identity map. Nevertheless, they are a kind of generalized inverses in the sense formalized in the notion of an adjoint functor.</p>
Functors <span class="math">\(F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(G: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}\)</span> are <strong>adjoint functors</strong> if for any <span class="math">\(X \in \mathcal{C}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y \in \mathcal{D}\)</span>, there is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_functors#Hom-set_adjunction">isomorphism</a> <span class="math">\[ \begin{aligned}
\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}} (F(X),Y) \simeq \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}} (X,G(Y)).
\end{aligned} \]</span>

    }
\end{align*} -->
<p><span class="math">\(F\)</span> is called a <strong>left adjoint</strong> of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is called a <strong>right adjoint</strong> of <span class="math">\(F\)</span>.</p>
Why should this be true in the case of the forgetful functor <span class="math">\(R\)</span> and the free functor <span class="math">\(F\)</span> between <strong>Set</strong> and <strong>Grp</strong>? A group homomorphism <span class="math">\(\varphi :F(S) \to G\)</span> is completely determined if we know what it does to each generator of <span class="math">\(F(S)\)</span> i.e. each element of <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. In other words, what <span class="math">\(\varphi\)</span> really acts on is the underlying set of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. That is, giving <span class="math">\(\varphi\)</span> is equivalent to giving <span class="math">\(\psi : S \to R(G)\)</span>. <span class="math">\[ \begin{aligned}
\text{Hom}_{\bf{Grp}} (F(S),G) \simeq \text{Hom}_{\bf{Set}} (S,R(G))

<img src="/assets/img/posts/01-2017/free-functor.png" style="width: 180px;"/>
</center>
<p>so that the free functor is a left adjoint of the forgetful functor.</p>
Possessing an adjoint on one side does not imply possessing an adjoint on the other side, as this example also demonstrates; the forgetful functor <span class="math">\(R:{\bf Grp} \to {\bf Set}\)</span> does not have a right adjoint. The desired isomorphism <span class="math">\[ \begin{aligned}
\text{Hom}_{\bf{Grp}} (G,F(S)) \simeq \text{Hom}_{\bf{Set}} (R(G),S)
\end{aligned}, \]</span>
<center>
<img src="/assets/img/posts/01-2017/cofree-functor.png" style="width: 180px;"/>
</center>
<p>where now <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is a cofree functor, fails when <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is an empty set. Given a group homormophism from <span class="math">\(G\)</span> to <span class="math">\(F(S)\)</span>, there is no corresponding map (with a non-empty image) from <span class="math">\(R(G)\)</span> to an empty set. <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<!-- A deep understanding of adjoint functors seem to require knowing about representability of functors and Yoneda's lemma, neither of which I can competently explain. But they all have analogues in linear algebra by pretending that an inner product $\braket{v,u}$ is a morphism $\text{Hom}(v,u)$ in a category with one object $V$ (with linear maps between vector spaces as functors). [^1]. A functor $F:\mathcal{C} \to $**Set** is **representable** by $X \in \mathcal{C}$ if the functor can be concretely realized as the morphism Hom$_{\mathcal{C}}(X,\cdot)$. The **Yoneda's lemma** guarantees that this $X$ is unique. In this analogy, the representability of $F$ combined with the Yoneda's lemma has the same content as the [Riesz representation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesz_representation_theorem) in linear algebra. It says that a continuous linear functional $f:V \to k$, where $k$ is now the analog of **Set**, can be identified as a unique vector in $v \in V$ itself via the inner product
$$ \begin{aligned}
f (u) = \braket{v,u}.
\end{aligned} $$
Now consider the linear functional $v \mapsto \braket{L(v),u}$. By the representation theorem, there is $w \in V$ that realizes this map as $\braket{v,w}$. This is an image of the adjoint operator $w = L^*(u)$. By a similar argument, if $F$ and $G$ are adjoint functors
$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}} (F(X),Y) \simeq \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}} (X,G(Y)),
\end{aligned} $$
and the classes of morphisms are sets (which they usually are), the functor $Y \mapsto \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}} (X,G(Y))$ is represented by $F(X)$ and the functor $X \mapsto \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}} (F(X),Y)$ is represented by $F(Y)$, so they are unique by the Yoneda's lemma. A further analogy is that an adjoint functor may not exist, but if it exists, it is unique. -->

<p><strong>II.</strong></p>
<p>In representation theory, a restriction of a representation of a group <span class="math">\(G\)</span> to a subgroup <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is a functor whose left adjoint is the induction of a representation of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> to a “free” representation of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. There, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_representation">Frobenius reciprocity theorem</a> is nothing but the property of adjoint functors. I will talk about how this can be used to deduce the well known fact that each irreducible representation of SO(3) appears only once in the decomposition of functions on a sphere.</p>
