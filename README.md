title: About this site

---


This site was built based on Carl Boettiger's 
[labnotebook site](http://carlboettiger.info).
Carl publishes the source for his site on Github as the
[labnotebook project](http://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook) and
releases it all under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),
so setting my site up was as easy as following 
[his instructions](http://www.carlboettiger.info/README.html),
replacing the \_posts directory, and making a few CSS customizations.

Please report any errors or other feedback in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ketch/labnotebook/issues).
