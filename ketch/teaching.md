## Finite difference methods (AMCS 252)

For 5 years, I have developed Sage worksheets and IPython notebooks
for a course on numerical methods at KAUST (AMCS 252).
Some of the notebooks are fairly polished while others are quite 
basic.

 - [Notebooks from Spring 2014](http://github.com/ketch/AMCS252/)

I'm in the process of revising several of these for inclusion in an
upcoming course (Fall 2014).  Stay tuned!

## Short course: HyperPython

This is a 1-day course (designed to take about 7 hours) introducing the
basics of hyperbolic PDE theory and numerical discretization, and leading
up to the PyClaw package for solving advanced hyperbolic systems.  Traffic
flow and fluid dynamics are used as the primary examples.

## Short course: Teaching Numerics with Notebooks

These notebooks were prepared by myself and [Aron Ahmadia](http://aron.ahamadia.net)
for a tutorial we gave at SciPy 2014.  They're aimed at university professors
and others who wish to teach numerical methods with Python.

### About this page

*In 2011, I began keeping my teaching materials under version control.
In 2013, I began posting them in a public repository on Github, simply as a way
of backing them up.  In 2014, I started receiving occasional pull requests and
comments on those materials.  After 
[Greg Wilson's inspiring talk at SciPy 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e26rp6qPbA)
I decided I should make a bigger effort to enable others to reuse and
contribute to these materials.*
