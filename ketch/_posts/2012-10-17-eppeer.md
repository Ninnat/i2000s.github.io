title: The parallel EPPEER code
subtitle: Reproducing some basic parallel results
---

I tried out the EPPEER code, which uses two-step Runge-Kutta methods and
OpenMP, because Iâ€™m thinking of writing a shared-memory parallel ODE
solver code myself.

I downloaded the code from

[http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/\~schmitt/peer/eppeer.zip][]

unzipped, and ran

    gfortran -c mbod4h.f90 
    gfortran -c ivprkp.f90 
    gfortran -c -fopenmp ivpepp.f90 
    gfortran -fopenmp ivprkp.o ivpepp.o mbod4h.o ivp_pmain.f90
    ./a.out

I had to fix one line that was trying to open a logfile and failed. I
also set

    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

This runs the code with increasingly tight tolerances on a 400-body
problem. The output was (I killed it before it finished the really tight
tolerance run(s)

     tol, err, otime, cpu  0.10E-01 0.10702      2.9556      10.534    
     steps,rej,nfcn:  337   88     1399
     tol, err, otime, cpu  0.10E-02 0.93692E-01  4.9853      18.585    
     steps,rej,nfcn:  605  159     2465
     tol, err, otime, cpu  0.10E-03 0.66604E-01  7.9798      30.365    
     steps,rej,nfcn:  994  244     4015
     tol, err, otime, cpu  0.10E-04 0.47637E-01  12.026      46.477    
     steps,rej,nfcn: 1534  324     6175
     tol, err, otime, cpu  0.10E-05 0.24241E-01  18.239      70.756    
     steps,rej,nfcn: 2338  415     9391

If I understand correctly, the last column is total CPU time; the next
to last is wall time. For comparison, I ran it without parallelism:

    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

Then I got the following:

     tol, err, otime, cpu  0.10E-01 0.10702      10.382      10.382    
     steps,rej,nfcn:  337   88     1399
     tol, err, otime, cpu  0.10E-02 0.93692E-01  18.297      18.297    
     steps,rej,nfcn:  605  159     2465
     tol, err, otime, cpu  0.10E-03 0.66604E-01  29.814      29.815    
     steps,rej,nfcn:  994  244     4015
     tol, err, otime, cpu  0.10E-04 0.47637E-01  45.854      45.855    
     steps,rej,nfcn: 1534  324     6175
     tol, err, otime, cpu  0.10E-05 0.24241E-01  69.725      69.726    
     steps,rej,nfcn: 2338  415     9391
     tol, err, otime, cpu  0.10E-06 0.53727E-02  105.47      105.48    
     steps,rej,nfcn: 3539  484    14195

The numbers of function evaluations were identical, confirming that the
computations being performed were the same. The speedup (about 3x) is
very nice. We should be able to achieve something similar with
extrapolation.

These results are actually plotted in [the user guide][], at the end of
Section 4.
