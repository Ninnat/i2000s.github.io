Why, oh why does Google try to figure out what language I speak based on my IP rather than using my browser's language setting or my google account language?  Any time I delete cookies and then go to blogger, I'm greeted by this:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7e4bHccEQPI/Tkyzcy5FzgI/AAAAAAAAAnY/ZscezNgz4cc/s1600/Screen%2Bshot%2B2011-08-18%2Bat%2B9.35.59%2BAM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="52" width="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7e4bHccEQPI/Tkyzcy5FzgI/AAAAAAAAAnY/ZscezNgz4cc/s400/Screen%2Bshot%2B2011-08-18%2Bat%2B9.35.59%2BAM.png" /></a></div><br />The same goes for searching the web with Google -- it's always trying to send me to google.com.sa and give me search results in Arabic.  Even if I type 'www.google.com' into the browser bar; it redirects me!<br />This even though I'm logged into my Google account, which specifies English as my native language:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yX_tTvamdEs/Tky0ibuLFyI/AAAAAAAAAng/BhsONaGi_C8/s1600/Screen%2Bshot%2B2011-08-18%2Bat%2B9.42.15%2BAM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="142" width="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yX_tTvamdEs/Tky0ibuLFyI/AAAAAAAAAng/BhsONaGi_C8/s400/Screen%2Bshot%2B2011-08-18%2Bat%2B9.42.15%2BAM.png" /></a></div><br />It's maddening.  And there are plenty of pages like <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/blogger/thread?tid=3649c0e03b8f27bc&hl=en">this one</a> on Google's own websites where people have pointed out the problem, but to no avail.<br /><br />A tip for others who have this problem: I go to encrypted.google.com to search.  That one's always in English (which also doesn't really make sense).  I haven't found a good solution for Blogger, except to try all the available links until I get the right one.  If this blog ever disappears, it's probably because I clicked 'flag this blog as abusive' by accident too many times. <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4660225022390848760-4348360154197554647?l=scienceinthesands.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
