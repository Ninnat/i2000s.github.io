The other day I happened to notice that I had received well over 100 e-mails in one day.&nbsp; While that may or may not seem high to you, in my case this meant that I spent most of the day handling e-mails, since the majority of these actually required a response or some other action on my part (I'm organizing two workshops right now, which accounts for much of the traffic).<br /><br />I thought back to grad school days when I might or might not receive any e-mail on a given day.&nbsp; When did it all get so crazy?&nbsp; I decided it would be fun to find out.&nbsp; A bit of searching turned up the Python package imaplib, which allowed me to download headers for all messages (ever!) from my Gmail account.&nbsp; Then it was just a matter of extracting and reformatting the dates and plotting up a histogram with matplotlib.&nbsp; Here's the result:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BY1MXXROj8g/TU75BC5FS6I/AAAAAAAAAmM/VO4o7wQM648/s1600/David_email_hist2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="216" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BY1MXXROj8g/TU75BC5FS6I/AAAAAAAAAmM/VO4o7wQM648/s400/David_email_hist2.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Can you tell when I graduated and started working for KAUST?&nbsp; In the last few months prior to starting at KAUST, I got an average of about 250 messages a month.&nbsp; Within 2 months of starting at KAUST, that average was well over 1000, with some months substantially higher.&nbsp; Ah, the joys of being a professor...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4660225022390848760-6191338207795134566?l=scienceinthesands.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
