To facilitate my research and perhaps help someone else out there, I develop a python package based around numerical ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta methods, multistep methods, etc.) as objects.  The package is called <a href="http://web.kaust.edu.sa/faculty/davidketcheson/NodePy/">nodepy</a>, and has somewhat limited functionality.  However, it contains a very nice implementation of rooted trees, including the ability to compute all the things necessary for deriving order conditions of general linear methods.  It also has a lot of nice functionality for Runge-Kutta methods, including a lot of things related to low-storage methods and embedded methods.<br /><br />As of today, the package is finally <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nodepy/0.3">available on the PyPI server</a>, and therefore can be installed using<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">easy_install nodepy</span><br /><br />Hopefully this will encourage interested parties to try it out (or better yet, to contribute!)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4660225022390848760-2407045526263829698?l=scienceinthesands.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
