I just got notification that my first book, co-authored with Sigal Gottlieb and Chi-Wang Shu, is finally available for pre-order and will ship by the end of the month.&nbsp; The book is on strong stability preserving methods (the only existing book on the subject) and is, I think, a nice introduction to the subject.&nbsp; You can read more about it <a href="http://www.worldscibooks.com/mathematics/7498.html">here</a>.&nbsp; Apparently it has already sold almost 100 copies.&nbsp; If you do order a copy, you can get a 20% discount until March with the code "DCL032011".<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4660225022390848760-5285715899667341222?l=scienceinthesands.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
