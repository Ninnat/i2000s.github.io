I haven't updated this blog since my initial post months ago.  I'm not yet at KAUST (I move in 10 days), but I am actively involved in several aspects of KAUST already, like helping students select fall courses and preparing materials for KAUST's big <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/KAUST-science-tech/62009/prweb2576384.htm">inauguration</a> event.  More and more concrete information about mundane matters keeps trickling in as well: housing assignments, grade schools, stores on campus (the first restaurant is a Pizza Hut...ugh).<br /><br />I intend to start blogging here in earnest once I've relocated.  Then things should get interesting.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4660225022390848760-3310234982472339484?l=scienceinthesands.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
