This is a list of some of the tools that I use on a regular basis that have
come to be an essential part of my workflow.

## Writing papers

I use **LaTeX** for typesetting, and [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/)
for typing (here is [my .vimrc](https://github.com/ketch/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc)).
References are managed using **Bibtex**.  I also use
[Bibdesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/), which is a simple GUI frontend for
Bibtex files.

Most papers are kept in private repositories on
[Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org).  My coauthors and I use **Git** to
allow us to work reomtely on a paper and merge our changes.
If a coauthor is not comfortable with Git, papers are kept on **Dropbox**.

## Reading papers
I keep abreast of the literature using [Inoreader]() (an RSS feed reader) with
subscriptions to about a dozen arXiv and journal feeds.  I have a few alerts
set up on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com), which I also use for
finding specific papers.  See my post on
[Searching the Scientific Literature](http://www.davidketcheson.info/2011/10/27/searching-scientific-literature.html).


## Presentations
Lately, I write most presentations in **Keynote**.  I use
[Latexit](http://www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/) to typeset equations and paste
the resulting (vector) graphics onto slides.  For drawn diagrams, I use
[Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle).


## Code
Most of my coding is done with MacVim, in Python or Fortran.  I also use the following:

 1. IPython.  For interactive running and debugging.
 1. The Jupyter notebook (formerly IPython notebook).  For organizing, recording, and
    sharing code with animations and mathematics.
 1. [Github](http://github.com).  For collaborative code development.

## Plotting

[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [VisClaw](https://github.com/clawpack/visclaw).

## Teaching

 1. SageMathCloud
 2. The Jupyter notebook (formerly IPython notebook).

## Notes and productivity

 1. [NValt](http://brettterpstra.com/nvalt-2-2-public-beta/).  For managing
    plain-text notes, which I use for everything.
 1. [Omnifocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/).  For managing all the non-research stuff I do.
 1. [Gitit](http://gitit.net/).  Wiki software that runs the KAUST Mathwiki, for
    internal collaboration within my group.

## Websites

 1. [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  For building this website.
 2. [Coda](https://panic.com/coda/).  For the [Numerical Mathematics Group
     site](http://numerics.kaust.edu.sa)
