## Openness in research and teaching

I try to practice scientific research in the open as suggested in
[Reinventing Discovery](http://localhost:4000/2011/11/10/book-review-reinventing-discovery.html)
and scientific teaching in the open as suggested by 
[Greg Wilson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e26rp6qPbA).
The idea is that openness enables massive collaboration, and collaboration
leads to better tools, materials, and results.

 - My *open lab notebook* is hosted on this site
 - I post and discuss interesting results on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DavidKetcheson/posts)
 - I post my [teaching materials on Github](/teaching.html)
 - I post my [research code on Github](/code.html)
 - I have published some grant proposals on Figshare: 
    * [Wave Propagation for Next-Generation Supercomputers](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.639182), 
    * [Positive Numerical Solution of Differential Equations](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.639184), 
    * [High Performance Computing and High-Level Programming Concepts for Hyperbolic PDE Codes](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.639183)
 - I participate in the [Stack Exchange for Scientific Computing](http://scicomp.stackexchange.com)
 - I participate in the [Stack Exchange for Academia](http://academia.stackexchange.com)

## Scientific software and reproducibility

Software development is a critical part of science and deserves to be treated
as such.  Virtually all published science depends on numerous software tools.
I subscribe to the principles outlined in the 
[Science Code Manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org)
and the [Reproducible Research Standard](http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/papers/LFRSR12012008.pdf).

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of computational scientific results,
it is essential that we strive for a standard of reproducibility.  To this
end, I make all code used in my papers [publicly](http://github.com/ketch)
[available](http://bitbucket.org/ketch).  Where reasonable,
I try to make the code well-documented and easy to use.

## Scientific publishing and journal pricing

I believe that publishing publicly-funded scientific research should not
be a profit-motivated activity.  Charges for access to scientific publications
should be kept to a minimum.  I primarily publish my own work in relatively
inexpensive but highly respected journals run by non-profit professional 
societies ([SIAM](http://www.siam.org) and the [AMS](http://www.ams.org)).
I am a signatory to the [Cost of Knowledge](http://thecostofknowledge.com)
(Elsevier Boycott).  I do not support gold open access (i.e., author-pay) journals,
for reasons outlined 
[here](http://davidketcheson.info/2011/12/16/in-defense-of-submission-in-scientific.html).
I place preprints of all my manuscripts on the [arXiv](http://www.arxiv.org)
when I submit them for publication.  Where allowed by the publisher, I put the
final version of my published papers on my site, downloadable from
[my publications page](/publications.html).
