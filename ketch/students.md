I have many research projects waiting for the right student. You may be the
right student if you are interested in any or all of:

- Numerical analysis / numerical methods
- Time-dependent hyperbolic PDEs
- Shock waves
- Wave behavior in periodic and random materials
- Computational science
- Massively parallel computing
- Scientific software engineering
- Global optimization

Most of my research focuses on **numerical methods for time-dependent
partial differential equations**. I also work with methods for ODEs, because these are
frequently used for the time-integration of PDEs. My work focuses on the
analysis of the methods, their practical implementation, and their application
to interesting problems. The application problems primarily involve nonlinear
waves.  I'm especially interested in applications with unique features that make it
challenging to design good numerical methods.

To work with me, it is helpful to have some background in programming,
numerical analysis, and/or differential equations. Optimization often plays a
role in my work as well. Many other branches of mathematics may be relevant to
particular projects; some examples include group theory, graph theory, and
complexity theory. Typical projects may involve

 1. Devising new numerical methods for specific classes of differential equations (this may involve analysis and/or numerical optimization)
 1. Analyzing stability, accuracy, and efficiency of existing numerical methods
 1. Using numerical methods to understand interesting wave phenomena
 1. Developing [software](/code.html) for numerical modelling
 1. Extending software to run efficiently on new architectures

Any of these is likely to involve a significant amount of both analysis and
programming. If you have a strong background in some application area, that may
also be helpful.  If you are interested in working in [my
group](http://numerics.kaust.edu.sa), please stop by
my office on the 4th floor of al-Khwarizmi to discuss potential projects, or
e-mail me for an appointment.  You may also with to read the 
[guidelines for working in my group](guidelines.pdf).
