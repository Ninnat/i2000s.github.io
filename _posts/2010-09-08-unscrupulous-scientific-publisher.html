I received a rather surprising invitation in my inbox the other day:<br /><blockquote style="font-family: trebuchet ms;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Dear X,<br />Greetings from the</span><span style="color: #0087ce; font-size: 100%; font-weight: bold;">American Journal of Plant      Sciences(AJPS)</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">, which is published by the Scientific Research Publishing, USA. The  journal dedicates to the latest advancement of plant sciences and the  goal is to keep a record of the state-of-the-art research and promote  the research work in these fast moving areas. With an open access  publication model of this journal, all interested readers around the  world can freely access articles online. </span><span style="color: #cc0000; font-size: 100%;">Now we sincerely invite you to  join the editorial board of  </span><span style="color: #cc0000; font-size: 100%; font-weight: bold;">AJPS</span><span style="color: #cc0000; font-size: 100%;">. </span></blockquote>Surprising, because I'm not a plant scientist.  I've never collaborated with a plant scientist, written a plant science paper, or even thought about plant science beyond Biology 101.  I've received this invitation twice in the last two months in fact -- both times addressed to my <span style="font-style: italic;">student</span> e-mail address at the University of Washington.  Apparently being an applied math grad student is qualification enough to edit articles for this journal.<br /><br />This isn't the first such invitation of its kind I've received.  Previously, I was one of the countless scientists spammed by <a href="http://www.bentham.org/open/">Bentham Open</a>. That invitation was at least subject-appropriate (the "Open Numerical Methods Journal").  But claiming they had targeted me because of my "eminence in the field" when I didn't yet have a Ph.D. seemed a bit of a stretch.  Both Bentham and the publisher of AJPS (Scientific Research Publishing) are establishing large numbers of so-called open-access journals that seem to be, in practice, little more than vanity press (they rely on author-pay funding).<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I went to the <a href="http://www.scirp.org/">publisher's website</a> and noticed that they have a journal in <a href="http://www.scirp.org/journal/am">applied math</a>.  I clicked through to the <a href="http://www.scirp.org/Journal/Abstract.aspx?paperID=2210&amp;JournalID=160">abstract</a> of an article with an intriguing title and found this:<br /><blockquote><span style="color: #ff9900; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold;">ABSTRACT</span>                  <br /><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms';">Approach to expansion of an  opportunity of the reception the guaranteed estimation for a problem of  reconstruction the impact within the limits of the dynamical algorithm  is considered in the article.  </span></div></blockquote>I really can't add anything to that.<br /><br />SCIRP's <a href="http://www.scirp.org/aboutUs/Index.aspx">'about us' page</a> contains the following memorable statement:<br /><blockquote>The company has an outstanding work team as well as the widespread third  party relations, enables our customers to obtain great satisfactions  and convenience in their publications.</blockquote>The grammatical hopelessness was no surprise to me at this point -- but notice that their customers are the authors, not the readers.  Well, at least they're honest about being vanity press.<br /><br />For more blog posts on this topic, look <a href="http://poynder.blogspot.com/2008/04/open-access-interviews-matthew-honan.html">here</a>, <a href="http://gunther-eysenbach.blogspot.com/2008/03/black-sheep-among-open-access-journals.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/09/this-message-has-been-sent-to-you.html">here</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4660225022390848760-3499496411451582686?l=scienceinthesands.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
