# Research

## Stabilizer quantum mechanics

- [Unbiased Simulation of Near-Clifford Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00111), Bennink et al. 2017
- [Simulation of Qubit Quantum Circuits via Pauli Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09070), Rall, Liang, Cook and Kretschmer 1901.09070
- [Efficient classical simulation of Clifford circuits with nonstabilizer input states](http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.11257), Bu and Koh 1902.11257

    Let $\mathcal{C}_3$ be a circuit composed of gates from the third level of [Clifford hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9908010).

    **Theorem 1.** The output probabilities of a circuit $\mathcal{C}_3$ on $n+m$ qubits with input state $\ketbra{0}{0}^{\otimes n} \otimes^m_{j=1} \rho_j$ and computational basis measurement can be approximated up to $l_1$ norm $\delta$ in
    $$(n+m)^{\mathcal{O}(1)} m^{\mathcal{O}\left[ \log \left( \sqrt{\alpha} /\delta \right)/\lambda \right]}.$$
    $\lambda$ measures the mixedness of the most pure $\rho_j$, namely the $\lambda = \epsilon$ for every qubit state of the form $(1-\epsilon)\ketbra{\psi}{\psi} + \epsilon\id/2$. The $1-2/\alpha$ comes from using the [Markov inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_inequality) on the average of the $l_1$ norm of the Fourier coefficients of the output probabilities over the uniform distribution of Cliffords (a [unitary 2-design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_t-design#Unitary_t-Designs)).  
   Since qudit ($d \ge 3$) Cliffords also form a 2-design, the latter technique should generalize. (The set of qubit Cliffords is not just a 2-design but also a [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02619)-[design](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02769).)

    When every input state is pure, the exponent blows up. For that, we have

    **Theorem 2** The output probabilities of a circuit $\mathcal{C}_3$ on $n+m$ qubits with input state $\ket{0}^{\otimes n} \otimes^m_{j=1} \ket{\psi_j}$ and computational basis measurement on $k$ qubits, the number of of unmeasured qubits being greater than the log of the *Pauli rank*
    $$ n+m-k \ge \sum^m_{j=1} \log \left( \frac{\chi(\psi_j)}{2} \right), $$
    can be approximated up to $l_1$ norm $\delta$ in
    $$ (n+m)^{\mathcal{O}(1)} m^{\mathcal{O}\left[ \log \left( \sqrt{\alpha} /\delta \right)/\mu \right]}, $$
    where now
    $$ \mu(\psi) := 2(1-\max_{\phi \in \mathrm{stab}} |\av{\phi|\psi}|^2). $$
    The fidelity to the closest stabilizer state is the *stabilizer rank*. Curiously, the more "stabilizer-ness" the *worse* the runtime!

    The method is inspired by ["Efficient classical simulation of noisy quantum computation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03176) by Gao and Duan, and much like that paper, Bu and Koh's paper is about *average-case* difficulty. Notably Gao and Duan's paper gives a classical simulation of a random quantum circuit with constant noise, seemingly contradicting the threshold theorem, but a fault-tolerant circuit is hardly a random circuit.

- Having talked to Kaifeng Bu, his ["Classical simulation of quantum circuits by half Gauss sums"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00224) is also interesting. Curiously, the paper also has something to say about the "Holant function", [related to perfect matchings on weighted graphs](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.634.7031&rep=rep1&type=pdf) (matchgate tensors).

Algebraic geometry

- *Linear Algebraic Groups*, Humphreys 1998
- John Baez on [Geometric quantization](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/01/geometric-quantization-part-1/) [[Nautilus](http://nautil.us/issue/69/patterns/the-math-that-takes-newton-into-the-quantum-world) article on how  algebraic geometry ("Hartshorne"), or rather algebraic topology finally clicked for him]


    According to some school of thought, quantization is a process of taking a symplectic manifold $M$ and turn it into a complex Hilbert space (and smooth functions--classical observables--to linear operators). But that is really just a "[prequantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_quantization#Prequantization)". Baez [points out](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/26/geometric-quantization-part-2/). We need much more than that; we need a line bundle $L$ over $M$ and various structures (even if $M$ is already Kähler) that make $L$ compatible with the symplectic, complex, and Riemannian structure on $M$. ([This](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/30/geometric-quantization-part-5/) shows you how it works for 2-spheres.)

    The world is quantum so perhaps it makes little sense to expect that just the symplectic structure can take us all the way to the complex Hilbert space. Instead, Baez [proposing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set), let us start with a complex projective variety $\C P^n \subset \C^{n+1}$, then take the smallest subspace in $V \subset \C^{n+1}$ whose [projectivized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectivization) space $\mathbb{P}V$ contains $M$ to be its quantization $Q(M) = V$. Projectivization then gives back
    $P(V) = M$. In this way, we have [poset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set) categories `Class` of classical state spaces and `Quant` of quantum state spaces and a pair of adjoint functors between them. You can make them [monoidal](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/28/geometric-quantization-part-4/) (essentially having the tensor product structure---Segre embedding for varieties) and [clone](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/01/08/geometric-quantization-part-7/) the system with symmetrized product (Veronese embedding for varieties). The latter is actually how you take a classical limit of generalized coherent states (equivalently, [scaling up the symplectic structure](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/01/21/geometric-quantization-part-8/)).

## Linear programming

- [Why are optimization problems called "programs"?](https://mathoverflow.net/a/145079/54448), MO

    > The military refer to their various plans or proposed schedules of training, logistical supply and deployment of combat units as a program. When I first analyzed the Air Force planning problem and saw that it could be formulated as a system of linear inequalities, I called my paper Programming in a Linear Structure. Note that the term ‘program’ was used for linear programs long before it was used as the set of instructions used by a computer. In the early days, these instructions were called codes.

    > One day sixty-six million years ago, life on Earth almost came to a shattering end. The world that emerged after the impact was a much simpler place. When sunlight finally broke through the haze, it illuminated a hellish landscape. The oceans were empty. The land was covered with drifting ash. The forests were charred stumps. The cold gave way to extreme heat as a greenhouse effect kicked in. Life mostly consisted of mats of algae and growths of fungus: for years after the impact, the Earth was covered with little other than ferns. Furtive, ratlike mammals lived in the gloomy understory. But eventually life emerged and blossomed again, in new forms.

    tl;dr version:

    In the 70's, Walter (geologist) and Luis Alvarez (nuclear physicist) discovered a KT layer laced with iridium, conjectured to be from the asteroid impact. The impact crater (named Chicxulub) was found in 1991. The debate was considered largely settled [in 2010](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5970/1214) (wow!) that the asteroid caused the extinction.

    "3 metre problem": almost no dinosaur remains have before been found 3 metres below the so-called "KT boundary", a layer of sediment that preserves the asteroid's debris and ash from the extinction event.

    [The new paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/27/1817407116) is a result from the discovery dated back to 2012 by a grad student Robert DePalma of the KT site "Tanis" (a Raiders-of-the-Lost-Ark reference) at Hell Creek in North Dakota. They even found preserved microtektites, a sort of glass beads or spindles that formed from molten rock ejected during the impact and solidified when re-entering the atmosphere. This suggests that the site recorded the first hours or so of the extinction event.

    Geophysics problem: there was not enough time for the flood that would preserve the microtektites to reach the site from the source of impact. They conjectured that the flood was caused by seiches that can happen far away from the source, and estimated the time all kinds of different seismic waves would arrive at the site to cause such seiches (6, 10, and 13 minutes).

    The data were from the observing runs all in April 2017. The research team dedicated to imaging was divided into four groups, crunching the data in four different ways. The final image is essential a composite of the four group images "update with higher-quality data".

    The next observing run in Spring next year should give us the spin of M87*. Meanwhile, the data that we have from observing Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of our galaxy, should already be enough to create a similar image. The only things required are "further advances in computational analysis" due to time variation.

    *Pros:* Great pixel art and attentions to details. Quite a number of objects interacts with time manipulation. (Yes, you play as Sakuya.) The water physics is especially cool. *Cons:* Snail Time and the grace mechanics makes the game really easy, in addition to the short length and the map not sprawling enough for a Metroidvania, which reminds me that I haven't finished [Rabi-Ribi](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400910/RabiRibi/). That one has a wondrous, sprawling map. (It is funny to bring up Rabi-Ribi as a comparison because it is a bullet hell game while Luna Nights is not, even though the latter is technically a Touhou game.)
