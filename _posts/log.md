Books

-[*An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Frontiers-Physics-ebook/dp/B0052TUEM8), Michael Peskin and Daniel Schroeder; Pro: Get right into QFT; Con: Get right into QFT without a primer on special relativity and group and representation theory, hard to see a big picture
-[*A Modern Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Physics/dp/0198520743), Michele Maggiore; Con: Does not get right into physics; Pro: Does not get right into physics but begin with group and representation theory, gives a nice excursion into the Wilsonian (condensed matter) view point of renormalization
-[*Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity*](https://www.amazon.com/GAUGE-FIELDS-KNOTS-GRAVITY-Everything/dp/9810220340), John Baez & Javier Muniain
