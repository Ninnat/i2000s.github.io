## 1. Research

### 1.1 Generalized coherent states (GCSs)

- [Coherent states: Theory and some applications (paywalled)](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.62.867), Zhang, Feng and Gilmore 1990

    The paper talks about group generalizations of the notion of [coherent states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_states), mainly of Perelomov and Gilmore. So naturally it mentions other approaches briefly but is quick to point out their drawbacks.

    1. Coherent states as eigenstates of lowering operators

    > [...] the adoption of this definition [...] has two major drawbacks, the first mathematical and the second physical:
    (a) Coherent states cannot be defined in Hilbert spaces of finite dimensionality in this way. In particular, this would preclude the construction of coherent states for compact Lie groups (Perelomov, 1972). Furthermore, states defined in this way have few useful properties and
    in particular they are not computationally useful.
    (b) The states so defined do not correspond to physically realizable states, except under the special circumstance that the commutator of the annihilation operator (or lowering step operator) and its Hermitian adjoint is a multiple of the identity operator. Therefore, under these conditions one restricts oneself to the electromagnetic field.

    2. Coherent states as minimum-uncertainty states

    > [...] this generalization has several limitations.  First of all, these coherent states can only be constructed for the classically integrable systems in which there exists a set of canonical coordinates and momenta such that the respective Hamiltonians can be reduced to quadrature. This condition requires a flatness condition on the Lie algebra, which reduces the commutation relations to those of the standard photon creation and annihilation operators. Secondly, the wave packets with minimum uncertainty are not unique (see Fig. 1). Different ones may have different properties. Such states may also be incomplete, or even if they are complete it is not certain that a resolution of unity of the standard form exists (Klauder and Skagerstam, 198S). Thus minimum-uncertainty states appear to have few, if any, useful properties. For example, minimum-uncertainty states do not evolve into minimum-uncertainty states when they are driven by a Hamiltonian linear in the generators in the Lie group.

    Revisiting this paper after a couple of years, now I would say that the group approach in which GCSs are defined to be the orbit of a [highest weight state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_(representation_theory)) does loosely generalize 1. and 2. as well.

    Even though minimum-uncertainty states don't generalize well, *minimum variance states* do. $\psi$ in an irrep of highest weight $\lambda$ is a *generalize coherent state* (GCS) iff the variance
    $$\mathrm{Var}(\psi) := \sum_j \av{X_j^2} - \sum_j \av{X_j}^2 $$
    is minimal. The first term is the Casimir eigenvalue which is fixed for a given irrep [^1]. The only states that maximize the second term are highest weight states with respect to *some* choice of [Cartan subalgebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan_subalgebra), and these are precisely in the orbit of the unique highest weight state with respect to a *fixed* Cartan subalgebra.

    The same trick of shifting Cartan subalgebras around lets us see ([semisimple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semisimple_Lie_algebra)) GCSs as eigenvectors of "lowering operators", taken to mean lowering operators in the $\sl(2,\C)$ Lie algebra [^2]. Given a semisimple Lie algebra $\g$ and its root space decomposition
    $$ \g = \bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Sigma_+} g_{-\alpha} \oplus \h \oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Sigma_+} g_{\alpha}, $$
    where $\h$ is our choice of a Cartan subalgebra, the highest weight state is by definition the 0-eigenstate of the nilpotent subalgebra $\bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Sigma_+} g_{\alpha}$, and again each state in the orbit of this state is a highest weight state with respect to some choice of a Cartan subalgebra.

    The comparison here with the traditional coherent states is a bit wonky as the Heisenberg group is nilpotent and not semisimple. Zhang et al. takes the symmetry Lie algebra of single-mode coherent states generated by $\{a,a\dgg,a\dgg a,1\}$, where 1 is the "scalar" in the commutator $[a\dgg,a] = 1$ and $a\dgg a$ is the number operator. 1 and $a\dgg a$ each has some property of an element of a Cartan subalgebra but not all. For instance, $a$ and $a\dgg$ are eigenvectors of the adjoint action of $a\dgg a$ but $[a\dgg,a] \not\propto a\dgg a$.

    I learned these interesting characterizations of GCSs from:


- [Coherent states, entanglement, and geometric invariant theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206012), Klyachko 2002 [[Extended (and corrected) version](https://arxiv.org/abs/0802.4008)]

More GCS:

  A highest weight state with respect to a choice of a Cartan subalgebra $\h$ has a physical interpretation as the ground state [^3] of a Hamiltonian in $\h$. Suppose that your quantum computation starts in the ground state of a fixed $\h_0$ and after some time you don't know what the state is anymore but you know that it is a GCS $\ket{\psi}$. This paper shows how to reconstruct a quantum circuit that prepares the GCS from the initial ground state by measuring observables $\{X_j\}$ in $\h_0$. The number of measurements and the reconstruct process are efficient in the dimension of the Lie algebra.

  Two tricks: The Hamiltonian
  $$ H = - \sum_j X_j \av{X_j}_{\psi}  $$
  has $\ket{\psi}$ as the ground state because the expectation value
  $$ - \av{H} =  \sum_j \av{X_j}^2 $$
  is exactly the quantity miximized only by $\ket{\psi}$. Then one diagonalizes the Hamiltonian to be in $\h_0$. Any complex semisimple $\g$ consists of a bunch of overlapping $\sl(2,\C)$ subalgebras, and in the end the task breaks up to diagonalizing each $\sl(2,\C)$ subalgebra: find a rotation that brings a linear combination of [Paulis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices) to a pure, fixed Pauli, $Z$ for example.

    An argument for the (canonical) diffeomorphism $ G/T \cong G^{\C}/B$ can be found in [Hogreve *et al.* 1990](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.cmp/1104200934), Section 2.3, p.472: the real span of $\g$ and $\mathfrak{b}$ is all of $\g^{\C}$, so the $G$-orbit is open in the $G^{\C}$ orbit ($G^{\C}/B$). On the other hand, the orbit is closed because of the compactness, thus they are the same. The argument extends to $ G/K \cong G^{\C}/P$ by defining $K = P \cap G$, then $K$ contains a maximal torus $T$.

[^1]: The Casimir eigenvalue is $\av{\lambda,\lambda + 2\delta}$, generalizing the $j(j+1)$ of the squared angular momentum, where $\delta = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\alpha \in \Sigma_+} \alpha$ is the ubiquitous half-sum of positive roots ([Knapp](https://www.amazon.com/Lie-Groups-Introduction-Anthony-Knapp/dp/0817642595), Proposition 5.28, p.295). For highest weight states, $\sum_j \av{X_j}^2 = \av{\lambda,\lambda}$, making the variance $\av{\lambda,2\delta}$.

[^2]: $\sl(2,\C)$ is what physicists call "$\mathfrak{su}(2)$" but it actually is a complexification of the *real* Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2)$.

[^3]: Actually the ground state is the lowest weight state, but the highest-weight and the lowest-weight descriptions are interchanged simply by relabeling the positive roots negative and vice versa.
