One of the great things about living at KAUST is that there's not much to do.<br /><br />No, really.  I mean it.<br /><br />For me, one of the most pleasant parts of life on this tiny campus has been the lack of constant activity and busy-ness that surrounded me in Seattle.  Like any small town, KAUST takes a slower, more casual approach to life.<br />That said, there's a danger to being an academic in a place like this.  I love my work.  Without the thousand constant distractions one finds elsewhere, it's easy to get completely lost in research -- 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  And I believe that, except perhaps for short stints, and despite the fact that sometimes inspiration does strike at 2 AM, such obsession is not a good thing.<br />This tendency of mine isn't uncommon in academia; for a comical (un)celebration of it, see <a href="http://youtu.be/yhncg6GXYq8">Uri Alon's <em>Sundays at the lab</em></a>.  Indeed, many people seem to <a href="http://sciencejobs.blogspot.com/2005/02/academia-creates-personal-life.html">get the impression</a> that you can't have a high-caliber academic research career without sacrificing your personal life, relationships, or sanity.<br />Though I'm still learning this dance, I can say that for me it's about balance: work hard, play hard, relax and sleep enough.  How does one maintain that balance in the microcosm that is KAUST?<br />The <em>work hard</em> part comes easily enough.  Outside of work, my two years here have been a journey toward doing fewer things, but better things with my time.  Some of the things that have kept me on an even keel:<br /><ul><li><strong>Spending time with my family.</strong>  This is the best part of the reduced busy-ness of KAUST.  We all have more time for each other.</li><li><strong>Developing wonderful friendships.</strong> Living in a small community forces you to get to know people better.  Surviving the initial chaos of living and working inside a construction site was a unique experience that forged some bonds of friendship that will last a lifetime.</li><li><strong>Starting to play music again.</strong>  It's great to have a creative outlet that doesn't require the same kind of mental concentration as mathematics.</li><li><strong>Scuba diving, windsurfing, and yoga.</strong>  You caught me -- that part about having <em>nothing to do</em> at KAUST wasn't exactly accurate.  I grew up a thousand miles from the ocean and I'm discovering for the first time the benefits of living near the (warm!) sea.</li></ul>Last but not least, I love to take quiet walks on the beach.  These are a great way to reconnect with myself and what really matters.  <br />Or to think up better numerical algorithms.   <br />After all, a mathematician's mind is never that far from, well, mathematics.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4660225022390848760-7730289964645845474?l=scienceinthesands.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
