  Let $\mathcal{C}_3$ be a circuit composed of gates from the third level of [Clifford hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9908010).

  **Theorem 1.** The output probabilities of a circuit $\mathcal{C}_3$ on $n+m$ qubits with input state $\ketbra{0}{0}^{\otimes n} \otimes^m_{j=1} \rho_j$ and computational basis measurement can be approximated up to $l_1$ norm $\delta$ in
  $$(n+m)^{\mathcal{O}(1)} m^{\mathcal{O}\left[ \log \left( \sqrt{\alpha} /\delta \right)/\lambda \right]}.$$
  $\lambda$ measures the mixedness of the most pure $\rho_j$, namely the $\lambda = \epsilon$ for every qubit state of the form $(1-\epsilon)\ketbra{\psi}{\psi} + \epsilon\id/2$. The $1-2/\alpha$ comes from using the [Markov inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_inequality) on the average of the $l_1$ norm of the Fourier coefficients of the output probabilities (inspired by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03176) by Gao and Duan) over the uniform distribution of Cliffords (a [unitary 2-design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_t-design#Unitary_t-Designs)).

  When every input state is pure, the exponent blows up. For that, we have

  **Theorem 2** The output probabilities of a circuit $\mathcal{C}_3$ on $n+m$ qubits with input state $\ket{0}^{\otimes n} \otimes^m_{j=1} \ket{\psi_j}$ and computational basis measurement on $k$ qubits, the number of of unmeasured qubits being greater than the log of the *Pauli rank*
  $$ n+m-k \ge \sum^m_{j=1} \log \left( \frac{\chi(\psi_j)}{2} \right), $$
  can be approximated up to $l_1$ norm $\delta$ in $$ (n+m)^{\mathcal{O}(1)} m^{\mathcal{O}\left[ \log \left( \sqrt{\alpha} /\delta \right)/\mu \right]}, $$
  where now
  $$ \mu(\psi) := 2(1-\max_{\phi \in \mathrm{stab}} |\av{\phi|\psi}|^2). $$
  The fidelity to the closest stabilizer state is the *stabilizer rank*. Curiously, the more "stabilizer-ness" the *worse* the runtime!

- John Baez on [Geometric quantization](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/01/geometric-quantization-part-1/) [[Nautilus](http://nautil.us/issue/69/patterns/the-math-that-takes-newton-into-the-quantum-world) article on how  algebraic geometry ("Hartshorne"), or rather algebraic topology finally clicked for him]

    According to some school of thought, quantization is a process of taking a symplectic manifold $M$ and turn it into a complex Hilbert space (and smooth functions--classical observables--to linear operators). But that is really just a "[prequantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_quantization#Prequantization)". Baez [points out](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/26/geometric-quantization-part-2/). We need much more than that; we need a line bundle $L$ over $M$ and various structures (even if $M$ is already Kähler) that make $L$ compatible with the symplectic, complex, and Riemannian structure on $M$. ([This](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/30/geometric-quantization-part-5/) shows you how it works for 2-spheres.)

    The world is quantum so perhaps it makes little sense to expect that just the symplectic structure can take us all the way to the complex Hilbert space. Instead, Baez [proposing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set), let us start with a complex projective variety $\C P^n \subset \C^{n+1}$, then take the smallest subspace in $V \subset \C^{n+1}$ whose [projectivized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectivization) space $\mathbb{P}V$ contains $M$ to be its quantization $Q(M) = V$. Projectivization then gives back
    $P(V) = M$. In this way, we have [poset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set) categories ``Class`` of classical state spaces and ``Quant`` of quantum state spaces and a pair of adjoint functors between them. You can make them [monoidal](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/12/28/geometric-quantization-part-4/) (essentially having the tensor product structure---Segre embedding for varieties) and [clone](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/01/08/geometric-quantization-part-7/) the system with symmetrized product (Veronese embedding for varieties). The latter is actually how you take a classical limit of generalized coherent states (equivalently, [scaling up the symplectic structure](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2019/01/21/geometric-quantization-part-8/)).

    > “I look at some of my former students and I wonder if they’re really trying to make the world better, or just make money,” said Fogg. “What I always wanted to do was un-enslave people from technology.”

    > Harris was Mike Krieger’s collaborator on Send the Sunshine in Fogg’s class of 2006. Like Krieger, Harris went on to create a real-world app, Apture, which was designed to give instant explanations of complex concepts to online readers [...] Harris believed in his mission to explain, yet he could not persuade publishers that incorporating his app would lead to people spending more time on their sites. He came to believe that the internet’s potential to inform and enlighten was at loggerheads with the commercial imperative to seize and hold the attention of users by any means possible.

    > After working for Google for a year or so, Harris resigned [...] Before leaving, he gave a farewell presentation to Google’s staff in which he argued that they needed to see themselves as moral stewards of the attention of billions of people. Unexpectedly, the slides from his talk became a viral hit inside the company, travelling all the way to the boardroom. Harris was persuaded to stay on and pursue his research at Goo­gle, which created a new job title for him: design ethicist and product philosopher. After a while, Harris realised that although his colleagues were listening politely, they would never take his message seriously without pressure from the outside. He left Google for good earlier this year [...]
