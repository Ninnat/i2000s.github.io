In <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k77982&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup143448">this succinct memo</a>, an advisory council at Harvard says that<br /><blockquote><em><span style="background-color: white;">major periodical subscriptions, especially to electronic journals</span>&nbsp;published by historically key providers, cannot be sustained: continuing these subscriptions on their current footing is financially untenable.</em></blockquote>
It recommends the following course of action to the faculty:<br /><blockquote><em>&nbsp;If on the editorial board of a journal involved, determine if it can be published as open access material, or independently from publishers that practice pricing described above. If not, consider resigning.</em></blockquote>
It also specifies that <br /><blockquote><em>"it is untenable for contracts with at least two major providers to continue on the basis identical with past agreements."</em></blockquote> but doesn't mention which two. &nbsp;Presumably they are a subset of {Springer, Elsevier, Wiley}.
