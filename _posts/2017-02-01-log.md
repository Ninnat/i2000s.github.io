### Books and focused readings

Books
- [*An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Frontiers-Physics-ebook/dp/B0052TUEM8), Michael Peskin and Daniel Schroeder 1995; (Chapter 1-7) Pros:
  - Jumps right into QFT
  - Has everything; cited by other textbooks
Cons:
  - Jumps right into QFT without a preparation on special relativity and representation theory
  - Has everything but you can't find it until you already know it; hard to grasp a big picture
- [*A Modern Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Physics/dp/0198520743), Michele Maggiore 2005; Cons:
  -Does not jump right into QFT
Pros:
  - Does not jump right into QFT but prepare a reader with special relativity and representation theory
  - Concise and modern (teaches the Wilsonian viewpoint of renormalization with block spin renormalization)
- [*Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity*](https://www.amazon.com/GAUGE-FIELDS-KNOTS-GRAVITY-Everything/dp/9810220340), John Baez and Javier Muniain 1994 (Part 1-2)

Defecting on that norm is so much worse than harming a particular person, or army, or country. It's harming our *ability to limit harm to each other* — a meta-harm."
