**Focused readings**

- [*Personality*](https://www.amazon.com/Personality-Makes-Oxford-Landmark-Science/dp/0199211434), Daniel Nettle; [Excerpt with comments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PMLHxXeUKEYgig9mEwQWCkuBBvMfUxcQXDK-chgCYUs/edit)
- "Introduction to Categories" in [*Introduction to Representation Theory*](http://math.mit.edu/~etingof/replect.pdf), Etingof *et al.*

- [Lie Groups and Representations: Math G4344](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/LieGroups-2012/), Woit; in particular, ["Homogeneous Vector Bundles and Induced Representations"](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/notes13.pdf), ["Induced representations and Frobenius Reciprocity"](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/LieGroups-2012/inducedreps.pdf) and ["The Peter-Weyl Theorem"](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/LieGroups-2012/peterweyl.pdf)
- ["Introduction to Symplectic Manifolds"](http://faculty.tcu.edu/richardson/Seminars/symplectic.pdf); certain mappings from coordinates on a phase space to a dual Lie algebra called moment maps can give conserved quantities that are more general than those obtained by Noether's theorem that only deals with the configuration space. The cross product formula for angular momenta $\bold{q \times p = L}$ is an example of such maps. This answers my curiosity: the $\mathfrak{so}(3)$ Lie algebra can be identified with vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ via the cross product. These vectors in turn can be identified with either coordinates or momenta. How to generalize a construction like this that takes two copies of a Lie algebra to a new Lie algebra?
- ["Generalizations of entanglement based on coherent states and convex sets"](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0207149), Barnum, Knill, Ortiz and Viola 2003

## December

**Focused readings**

- ["Phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and quantum state reconstruction of physical systems with Lie-group symmetries"](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9809052), Brif and Mann 1999
- [*An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Frontiers-Physics-ebook/dp/B0052TUEM8), Michael Peskin and Daniel Schroeder 1995; (Chapter 1-7) Pros: 1. Jumps right into QFT 2. Has everything, as it is often cited by other textbooks. Cons: 1. Jumps right into QFT without a preparation on special relativity and representation theory 2. Has everything but you can't find it until you already know what to look for. Hard to grasp a big picture
- [*A Modern Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Physics/dp/0198520743), Michele Maggiore 2005; Cons: Does not jump right into QFT. Pros: 1. Does not jump right into QFT but prepare a reader with special relativity and representation theory 2. Concise and modern (teaches the Wilsonian viewpoint of renormalization with block spin renormalization)
- [*Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity*](https://www.amazon.com/GAUGE-FIELDS-KNOTS-GRAVITY-Everything/dp/9810220340), John Baez and Javier Muniain 1994 (Part 1-2); Strikes a good balance between rigorous math and physicists' math. Doubles as a quick introduction to differential geometry
- "Chern-Simons quantum field theories" in [*Introduction to Topological Quantum Computation*](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Topological-Quantum-Computation-Jiannis/dp/1107005043), Pachos 2012
