Books

- [*Personality*](https://www.amazon.com/Personality-Makes-Oxford-Landmark-Science/dp/0199211434), Daniel Nettle [[Excerpt with comments]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PMLHxXeUKEYgig9mEwQWCkuBBvMfUxcQXDK-chgCYUs/edit)

# 2016

## Studied

- [*An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Frontiers-Physics-ebook/dp/B0052TUEM8), Michael Peskin and Daniel Schroeder; (Chapter 1-7) Pros:
-- Jumps right into QFT
-- Has everything; cited by other textbooks
Cons:
-- Jumps right into QFT without a preparation on special relativity and representation theory
-- Has everything but you can't find it until you already know it; hard to grasp a big picture
- [*A Modern Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Physics/dp/0198520743), Michele Maggiore; Cons:
--Does not jump right into QFT
Pros:
-- Does not jump right into QFT but prepare a reader with special relativity and representation theory
-- Concise and modern (teaches the Wilsonian viewpoint of renormalization with block spin renormalization)
- [*Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity*](https://www.amazon.com/GAUGE-FIELDS-KNOTS-GRAVITY-Everything/dp/9810220340), John Baez and Javier Muniain (Part 1-2)

- ["Frames, designs, and spherical codes in quantum information theory"](http://www.iap.tu-darmstadt.de/tqp/grp_jrenes/thesis.html), Renes (2004)
- ["Evenly distributed unitaries: on the structure of unitary designs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611002), Gross, Audenaert and Eisert (2007)
- ["The Clifford group fails gracefully to be a unitary 4-design"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08172), Zhu, Kueng, Grassl and Gross (2016)
- ["Low rank matrix recovery from Clifford orbits"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08070), Kueng, Zhu and Gross (2016)
