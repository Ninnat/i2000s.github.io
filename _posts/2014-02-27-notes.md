Investigated stability regions for high order deferred correction schemes; see [this notebook](https://bitbucket.org/ketch/rkextrapolation/src/a78b4aa2d336491cac35c1df81e703ce103d6937/SDC%20Stability%20regions%20when%20theta%20is%20nonzero.ipynb).

Finally, after about a year of searching, found a way to redirect all output from distutils
to a file.  This will avoid the massive amount of warnings that are currently printed to the
screen when installing PyClaw.  See the patch [here](https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack/pull/35),
based on [this StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11632982/786902).


I also put together an [IPython notebook on shallow water solitary waves over periodic
bathymetry](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/656693/shallow_water_diffraction.ipynb).
It will be in the Github repo soon.
