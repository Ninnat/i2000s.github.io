Note: This post was originally written by <a href="http://www.davidketcheson.info/2011/10/28/managing-publication-lists-in-html.html" target="_blank">David Ketcheson</a> and updated to my case.

<p>As an academic, it's a good idea to maintain a <a href="http://web.kaust.edu.sa/faculty/davidketcheson/">professional website</a> with a <a href="http://web.kaust.edu.sa/faculty/davidketcheson/publications.html">list of your publications</a>.  Ideally, this list should include links to where visitors can download the papers (PDFs) <a href="http://sciencecodemanifesto.org">and any related code</a>.  In my case, I also maintain a <a href="http://numerics.kaust.edu.sa">website for my research group</a> that has another <a href="http://numerics.kaust.edu.sa/publications.html">publication list.</a> Of course, you need to maintain local reference files with the citation info for your publications (for inclusion in later publications), as well as your CV.</p><p>Maintaining all these separate lists can become very tedious, which is probably why most academics' sites are usually out-of-date.  Here's how I automate much of it:</p><ul><li><strong>I use <a href="http://www.bibtex.org/">Bibtex</a>. </strong>This allows automatic generation of bibliographies for papers and for my CV.  And it's the basis for generating HTML bibliographies, as outlined below.</li><li><strong>I use <a href="http://www.mendeley.com">Mendeley</a>.</strong> Mendeley allows me to create separate bibliographic lists (e.g., for my own publications and for those of my research group) and <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/blog/tipstricks/howto-use-mendeley-to-create-citations-using-latex-and-bibtex/">export them as bibtex files</a>, using the desktop app.  It's also possible to <a href="http://bibbase.org/cgi-bin/mendeley/Mendeley-oapi/requestToken.py">get a bibtex file of your Mendeley publications directly on-line</a> through <a href="http://www.bibbase.org">BibBase</a>.  You can even <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/blog/academic-features/if-you-publish-a-paper-but-nobody-reads-it-does-it-make-a-difference/#more-26402">display a list of your publications on-line automatically using Mendeley,</a> but it's not very customizable; for instance, they appear in alphabetical, rather than chronological order.</li><li><strong>I would use <a href="http://www.bibbase.org/">BibBase</a></strong> to <a href="http://www.bibbase.org/help/">automatically display an updated bibliography</a> if my institutional server ran PHP or CGI scripts, but no luck there.</li><li>My less-automatic solution is <strong><a href="https://github.com/ketch/tex2_rst_html">simple Python scripts</a></strong> that generate CSS-friendly HTML.  The scripts use the Python module bibliograph to parse bibtex entries.  I could instead use <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=bibtex2html&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lri.fr%2F~filliatr%2Fbibtex2html%2F&amp;ei=EqqqTubIK4zC8QPF7sySCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFE8lFV7TxfgvapcrTjFvSDcEqyng">bibtex2html</a>.  I like my solution better because the customization is all done using CSS rather than Python, so I can change the look without re-generating the HTML.  Of course, bibtex2html is a more polished and flexible tool than my 30-line script.</li><li>Here's a CSS snippet that's used for <a href="http://numerics.kaust.edu.sa/publications.html">this publication list</a>:</li></ul><pre class='brush:css;'><br />#pub {padding: 5px; border-width: 2px; border-style: none; background-color: #eee4b5; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;}<br />#pub a{font-weight: bold; color: #09434e;}<br />#pub name{font-weight: bold; color: #09434e;}<br />#pub journal{font-style: italic;}<br /></pre><p> </p><p>The workflow for adding a new paper to an html bibliography is:</p><ol><li>Add the paper in Mendeley.</li><li>Export bibtex from Mendeley.</li><li>Run Python scripts.</li><li>Paste resulting HTML into the appropriate file.</li></ol><p>Again, it would be simpler if I could use Bibbase (cutting out steps 2-4).  It's still fairly painless, and it's easy to generate new bibilographic lists or customize the look of existing ones.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4660225022390848760-6191171778887335934?l=scienceinthesands.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

Update by Xiaodong Qi:

In Jekyll, like this site, you can also use the <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar" target="_blank">Jekyll-scholar</a> suit to manage bibtex database for your publication page in html.

If you use php or Wordpress on your web server, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/monperrus/bibtexbrowser" target="_blank">bibtexbrowser</a> tool.
I have customized one version under my <a href="https://github.com/i2000s/bibtexbrowser" target="_blank">Github repo</a> which is used for CQuIC's website site at <a href="http://cquic.unm.edu/cquic-publications/" target="_blank">http://cquic.unm.edu/</a> for a better outlook for physics publications.
