Looks like the folks at Mendeley have been quietly making some big improvements.<br /><br />When I first started using Mendeley, I decided to drag a folder of one hundred or so PDFs into it, since it could extract the bibliographic metadata from PDFs.  The consequences were disastrous, with a dozen documents named "Society" and all published in "Science".  Overall, less than half were correctly imported, and many entries were unrecognizable.<br /><br />Since then, I don't drag PDFs into Mendeley.  This means that bringing in a new document requires a few steps: get the metadata from a journal webpage (automatically using a bookmarklet), download the PDF, and finally associate the PDF to the document.<br /><br />Today, by accident, I happened to drag a PDF into Mendeley.  To my surprise, it was imported perfectly, with all bibliographic data correct.  I decided to try another.  And a few more.  All came in perfectly.  I also found that dragging a PDF of a paper already in my library DID NOT create a duplicate.<br /><br />Thanks, Mendeley developers.  Please keep it up.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4660225022390848760-3391930448683882207?l=scienceinthesands.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
