This is the fourth post in my [series on habits of the open
scientist](http://davidketcheson.info/2012/07/31/habits-of-open-scientist.html).
Here I discuss the fourth habit, **open collaboration**.  The previous post was
on [Pre-publication dissemination of
research](http://davidketcheson.info/2012/08/22/habits-of-open-scientist-3-pre.html).

As mentioned in the introduction to this series, the first three habits are
truly essential for any conscientious scientist.  With the fourth habit, we're
moving into things that are valuable but less essential -- *advanced open
science*, if you will.
 
What do I mean by open collaboration?  The use of online tools and social media to connect with new collaborators and provide your own expertise where it is needed most.  For an excellent introduction to the subject, go read [Michael Nielsen's book, *Reinventing  Discovery*](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/reinventing-discovery/). Here I'll just focus on a few examples from my own experience:

### Scientific Q&A sites

Often scientific research involves elements of work that have been done before
or are already well understood -- by someone, somewhere.  Sometimes this work
is published and readily available, but other times it is unpublished or
perhaps published in a place you wouldn't know to look.  Finding the person
with the specialized knowlege you need might take much longer than "reinventing
the wheel", i.e. redoing the work yourself.  Enter StackExchange, an engine for
connecting questions with correct answers and making them readily available.

I'm an avid participant in (and former moderator of) the
[Stack Exchange for Computational Science](http://scicomp.stackexchange.com).  I also use [Mathoverflow](http://mathoverflow.net) and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).    Some personal examples of the kind of connections I'm talking about are [here](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/86977/polynomials-that-are-orthogonal-over-curves-in-the-complex-plane/) and [here](http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/65/are-there-operator-splitting-approaches-for-multiphysics-pdes-that-achieve-high).  These are conversations that would never have taken place "in real life" simply because the people involved have never met each other.

I also find the [TeX stack exchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com) to be a gold
mine, and typically far more useful than browsing through package documentation
on CTAN.
 
### Social networks like [Google+](http://plus.google.com)
 
I use Google+ (and previously Reader, which was a far superior tool) for
sharing new papers that I think may be of interest to my collaborators.  I've
also used it to debate journals' editorial policies (with the editors) and for
preliminary planning of conferences and proposals -- to find out who may be
interested in participating.  It's certainly not suited to discussing
scientific or mathematical concepts in any detail, and it is annoyingly
difficult to sort through new things that are posted.  I think that Facebook is
less useful for this purpose because Facebook is used primarily for personal
content whereas a large community of G+ users (of which I am part) consider it
to be a platform for sharing professional content.  But I'm not a good judge --
I don't even have a Facebook account.

### [Github](http://github.com)
 
I wanted to say "sites like Github", but I don't think there are any others.
Online code hosting sites have long facilitated collaboration between existing
teams, but Github takes this to a new level by explicitly promoting
collaboration between people who have never met.  Surprisingly, this paradigm
shift didn't require any new technology.  Rather, it stems from a combination
of their "code first, ask permission later" pull-request mindset and subtle
differences in the user interface -- like a "fork me" button on every page,
just begging you to modify some stranger's code.

Now this philosophy -- and use 0f Github -- has moved beyond just sharing what
we usually think of as computer code.  For instance, Carl Boettiger puts [the
full source of his Jekyll-based website on
Github](http://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook), which enabled me (simply by
forking it) to easily set up this site.

### A word of caution

As useful as all the above are, I've found that they can also be a way of
wasting time.  You may find this to be the case if you're merely trading
opinions with strangers or consuming tidbits of information that aren't really
relevant to your research -- for instance, I find that my time spent on the
[Academia Stack Exchange](http://academia.stackexchange.com) is of dubious
value.  I stepped down from moderating the SciComp Stack Exchange because I
felt it was too time-consuming.  But if used in a focused way, open
collaboration tools can accelerate, enrich, and expand your research.

What other tools or sites ought to be mentioned here?  Let me know in the comments.
