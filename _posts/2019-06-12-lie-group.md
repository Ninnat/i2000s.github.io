# Lie groups
<!----------------------------------->

Lie groups are what happen when group theory meets calculus. A Lie group is not just a group. It is also a topological space i.e. it makes sense to say, for instance, that two group elements are close together or whether they are connected by a continuous path. But we need more in order to do calculus. The topological space must also have a differentiable structure. We say that a function is $C^k$ if all of its $k$th partial derivatives exist and are continuous. (A continuous function is $C^0$.) A $C^{\infty}$ function is said to be smooth. Formally, a topological space $M$ is a ($C^k$) **manifold** if it has the following properties:[^1]

1.  For any point $p \in M$, there is an open set $U$ and a
    homeomorphism (an invertible continuous map with continuous inverse)
    $\varphi$ to an open subset of $\R^n$. The pair
    $(U,\varphi)$ is called a **chart**.

2.  There is a collection of charts covering $M$ such that any pair of
    overlapping charts $(U_{\alpha},\varphi_{\alpha})$ and
    $(U_{\beta},\varphi_{\beta})$ is smoothly compatible i.e. the
    **transition map** $\varphi_{\beta} \circ \varphi_{\alpha}^{-1}$ is
    $C^k$.

A **Lie group** is a smooth manifold that has a compatible group structure i.e. group multiplication and inversion are smooth.[^2] A paradigmatic example of a Lie group is the general linear group
$\GL(n,\R)$ of real invertible $n \times n$ matrices. It is
an open subset (of $\R^{n^2}$) of matrices with non-zero
determinant since the determinant is a polynomial and therefore
continuous, and the image $\R\backslash \{0\}$ is open.[^3]
Multiplication is linear and thus smooth, and inversion is smooth by
[Cramer's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule) $A^{-1} = \mathrm{adj}(A)/\det A$.

<!----------------------------------->
## The Lie algebra of a Lie group
<!----------------------------------->

A Lie group $G$ may have an infinite number of generators, but it is a fact that any neighborhood of the identity element generates the
component of $G$ connected to the identity. The idea of the Lie algebra is to describe $G$ by the "linear approximation" of $G$ at the identity. Let $C^{\infty}(M)$ be the set of all smooth functions on $M$. Locally at each point $p$ on an $n$-manifold $M$, we can take partial derivatives in $n$ linearly independent directions. They are linearly independent as vectors because for every $f \in C^{\infty}(M)$ and $a\in\R$, if
$$\begin{align}
\sum_{j=1}^n a_j \partial_j f &= 0\end{align}$$
then all $a_j=0$, thus they form an $n$-dimensional vector space called the **tangent space** $T_p M$ at the point $p$. Globally, define a **vector field** to be a linear function $X:C^{\infty}(M) \to C^{\infty}(M)$ obeying the Leibniz rule:
$$\begin{align}
X(fg) &= f X(g) + X(f) g\end{align}$$
for every $f,g \in C^{\infty}(M)$ i.e. a *derivation*. Intuitively, a vector field assigns to each point on a manifold a vector that allows us to take a derivative in that direction. Denote the set of all vector fields on $M$ by $\mathfrak{X}(M)$. Two vector fields can be composed together but the product is not a derivation. Instead $\mathfrak{X}$ can be endowed with the anticommutative product that gives another derivation, the **Lie bracket**:[^4]
$$\begin{align}
[X,Y] = X \circ Y-Y \circ X.\end{align}$$
The *Jacobi identity*
$$\begin{align}
[X,[Y,Z]] + [Y,[Z,X]] + [Z,[X,Y]] &= 0,\end{align}$$
says that the Lie bracket is a derivation with respect to itself
$$\begin{align}
[X,[Y,Z]] &= [Y,[X,Z]] + [[X,Y],Z].\end{align}$$
Given two smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$, and a smooth map $\varphi: M \to N$, we can construct a linear map from $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ to
$\mathfrak{X}(N)$. The [**differential**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_(differential)) (or *pushforward*) $d\varphi$ of $\varphi$ is defined to be
$$\begin{align}
[d\varphi(X)](f) &\coloneqq  X[f \circ \varphi],\end{align}$$
$X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ and $f \in C^{\infty}(N)$. When $M = G$ is a group, there is a distinct subset of vector fields whose value everywhere can be translated from the value at the identity $e$ by the differential of (left) group multiplication $X(g) = dg [X(e)]$. The **Lie algebra** $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ of a $G$ is defined to be these left-invariant vector fields isomorphic to $T_e G$.

From the discussion above, it will come as no surprise that an abstract **Lie algebra** $\g$ is defined as a vector space together with a bilinear map $[\, , \, ]: \g \times \g \to \g$, which is antisymmetric $[X,Y] = -[Y,X]$ for every $X,Y \in \g$ (or equivalently
$[X,X]=0$) and satisfies the Jacobi identity.

<!----------------------------------->
### Non-obvious examples
<!----------------------------------->

- The cross product $A \times B$ is bilinear, antisymmetric, and satisfies the Jacobi identity. (Can you prove it?) Thus, vectors in $\R^3$ equipped with the cross product is a Lie algebra, more specifically, $\so(3,\R)$. To see this, we may use the concept of a [*tensor operator*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_operator) (which is really an [intertwiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivariant_map) of representations, something that I want to explain in a separate post) from physics to identify
$$\begin{align}
  x \leftrightarrow L_x = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & -1 \\
    0 & 1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}, &&
  y  \leftrightarrow L_y = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 \\
    -1 & 0 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}, &&  
  z  \leftrightarrow L_z = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & -1 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{align}$$
$$\begin{align}
  v \times w \leftrightarrow [L_v,L_w],
\end{align}$$
and directly verify the $\so(3,\R)$ commutation relations
$$\begin{align}
  [L_x,L_y] = L_z, && [L_y,L_z] = L_x, && [L_z,L_x]=L_y.
\end{align}$$

    This only happens because of an accidental isomorphism in three dimensions, namely that *specifying a rotation is equivalent to specifying a plane (hence an axis) of rotation*. This is not true in higher dimensions $n$, as you need up to $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ planes. The Lie algebra $\so(n,\R)$ is the set of planes of rotations $\wedge^2 \R^n$, where $\wedge^k \R^n$ is the $k$th [*exterior power*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra) of $\R^n$ of dimension $n \choose k$. In general, each vector in $\wedge^k V$ is a subspace of $V$ spanned by $k$ linearly independent vectors. Since $\wedge^k V$ and $\wedge^{n-k}V$ have the same dimension, there is a linear isomorphism between them. The (generalized) cross product is just an isomorphism $\wedge^2 \R^n \cong \so(n,\R) \to \wedge^{n-2} \R^n$, the latter of which is $\R^n$ if and only if $n=3$.

- Another important Lie algebra in physics is the [Poisson bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_bracket)
$$\{f,g\} = \pder{f}{q}\pder{g}{p} - \pder{f}{p}\pder{g}{q}.$$

<!----------------------------------->
## The adjoint representation
<!----------------------------------->

A *representation* of a Lie algebra $\g$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism $\pi: \g \to \text{End}(V)$ i.e. a linear map respecting the Lie bracket:
$$\begin{align}
\pi([X,Y]) = [\pi(X),\pi(Y)]\end{align}$$
for all $X,Y \in \g$.
The *adjoint representation* of $\g$ is the Lie algebra homomorphism
$$\begin{align}
\ad: \g &\to \mathrm{End}\g, \\
\ad X (Y) &= [X,Y].\end{align}$$
It is the differential of the adjoint representation of the Lie group $G$ on $\g$:
$$\begin{align}
\Ad g (X) = gXg^{-1},\end{align}$$
mraning that they are related by the well known identity
$$\begin{align} e^Y X e^{-Y} = e^{\ad{Y}} X = X + [Y,X] + \frac{1}{2!}[Y,[Y,X]] + \cdots.
\end{align}$$

<!----------------------------------->
## Lie subgroups
<!----------------------------------->

There is more than one possible way to define a submanifold which, in
turn, affects the definition of a Lie subgroup. A smooth map
$\varphi:M \to N$ is an **immersion** if its differential $d\varphi$ has full rank $\dim M$ for every point $p$ on $M$ [^5]. An **immersed submanifold** $N \subset M$ is a subset of $M$ which is itself a smooth manifold and the inclusion map $\imath: N \inject M$ is an immersion. A stronger notion is that of an **embedded submanifold**, an immersed submanifold such that the inclusion map is a homeomorphism. An embedded submanifold inherits the topological structure from the manifold while an immersed submanifold may not. An example of the latter is the "figure 6" map that takes an open interval to a shape with a different topology.

Subgroups of a Lie group which are also immersed submanifolds are in
one-one correspondence to Lie subalgebras of the group. Thus, one call these subgroups **Lie subgroups**. Lie subgroups that are also embedded as submanifolds are not hard to come by as a result of the following theorem:

**Theorem.** *(The closed subgroup theorem)* [Lee, Theorem
20.12 p. 523]
Any subgroup that is also a (topologically) closed subset is a Lie subgroup which is embedded as a submanifold.

Note that the subset only needs to be closed in $G$ and not in any ambient space that $G$ is sitting in.

As an application of the theorem, since $\GL(n,\R)$ is a Lie group, a subgroup $G$ of $\GL(n,\R)$ such that any sequence of matrices in $G$ either converges in $G$ or outside $\GL(n,\R)$ (not invertible) is also a Lie group, called a (real) **matrix Lie group**. The Lie algebra of a matrix group $G$ is the set of all matrices $X$ such that the exponential $e^X$ lands in $G$. For example the Lie algebra of $\GL(n,\R)$ is  the set of all real $n \times n$ matrices.

*Introduction*

## $G$-Vector Bundles
<!----------------------------------->

The **tangent bundle** $TM$ over an $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ is the collection of tangent spaces at every point $p \in M$.
$$\begin{align}
TM = \bigcup_{p \in M} T_p M,\end{align}$$
itself a manifold of dimension $2n$.
A point in $TM$ is a pair $(p,v)$ of a point $p \in M$ and a tangent vector $v$ at that point. There is always a surjective projection $\pi$ from the bundle to $M$, sending $(p,v)$ to $p$. So a tangent bundle is often specified as $\pi:TM \to M$. In a more general bundle
$$\begin{align}
\pi: E \to M,\end{align}$$
we call $E$ the **total space** and $M$ the **base space**. The pre-image $\pi^{-1}(p)$ is called the **fiber** $E_p$ at $p$., which does not have to be a tangent space. But we will still look at $E_p$ that is a vector space, and in particular, a group representation. A right
inverse of the projection
$$\begin{align}
\sigma : M &\to E \\
\pi \circ \sigma &= id,\end{align}$$
where $id$ is the identity map, is called a **section** of the bundle. It assigns to each point in the
base space a vector in $E_p$. For the tangent bundle, a section is
nothing more than a vector field. But as we alluded to, the physical
fields and the gauge fields will be sections of a more general vector
bundle.

A bundle $E$ is **trivial** if it is just a Cartesian product
$E = M \times F$, where $F$ is called a **standard fiber**.

<center>
<img src = "/assets/img/posts/lie-group/fiber-bundle.png" style="width:280px;"/>
<br>
A cylinder is a trivial fiber bundle with a circle as the base
  manifold.
</center>

Trivial bundles are not so interesting. Nevertheless every bundle that we come across will be **locally trivial**. Local triviality with respect to the standard fiber $F$ means that there exists a neighborhood $U$ of each point $p \in M$ and a bundle isomorphism
$$\begin{align}
\phi: E\big|_U \to U \times F,\end{align}$$
sending each fiber to the trivial bundle $U \times F$. That is to say, $E$ is locally indistinguishable from the trivial bundle. Going in reverse, a nontrivial bundle can be built up by gluing trivial
bundles together. In a **$G$-bundle** [^6], the transition function
between overlapping neighborhoods $U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}$ in $M$:
$$\begin{align}
\phi_{\alpha \beta} &= \phi_{\alpha} \circ \phi_{\beta}^{-1}\end{align}$$
where $\phi_{\alpha}: E\big|_{U_{\alpha}} \to U_{\alpha} \times F$ is an element of a group $G$. In other words, the fiber at each point is now a $G$-representation.

<center>
<img src = "/assets/img/posts/lie-group/mobius.png" style="width:280px;"/>
<br>
A möbius strip has the same base manifold as the cylinder but is not a trivial bundle thanks to the twist $g\in \mathbb{Z}_2$ that joins the opposite ends of the fibers.
</center>

<!--Simultaneous actions of $G$ on every fiber with the same element $g$ are called **global gauge transformations**, whereas simultaneous actions of $G$ with $g$ that depends on each point in the manifold are **local gauge transformations**.-->

[^1]: Rigorously, there are two more requirements. First, $M$ must also be *Hausdorff* i.e. any two points in $M$ can be separated. Second, $M$ must be *second-countable* i.e. every open set is the union of a collection of a fixed countable basis of open sets. These technical requirements essentially serve to rule out pathological spaces. For example, if a space is not Hausdorff, a limit point may not be unique and a finite subset may not be closed. Sometimes second-countability is left out of the definition, but a Lie group that is not second-countable may violate the closed subgroup theorem below [Lee pp. 523-525].

[^2]: One can consider $C^k$ group manifolds for various $k$, but it turns out that every $C^0$ manifold with a compatible group structure can be made into a ($C^{\infty}$) Lie group in one and only one way ([Hilbert's 5th problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_fifth_problem)). This is an even stronger statement than the fact from complex analysis that a complex $C^1$ function is automatically complex $C^{\infty}$.

[^3]: If $f$ is continuous, the pre-image $f^{-1}(X)$ of an open set $X$ is open.

[^4]: $C^{\infty}(M)$ is a commutative ring as functions can be multiplied together point-wise. So $\mathfrak{X}$ is a $C^{\infty}(M)$-module. The Lie bracket turns $\mathfrak{X}$ into a $C^{\infty}(M)$-algebra.

[^5]: A way to remember the two kinds of smooth maps: immersion and submersion, is that an **i**mmersion has an **i**njective differential, while a **s**ubmersion has a **s**urjective differential.

[^6]: In some terminology, a $G$-bundle or a principal $G$-bundle is not a vector bundle, but its associated vector bundle is. What we describe is the associated vector bundle.
