But when it comes to analysis, they may loose their judgment, and grave mistakes show up at the corner. Analysis is not easily amenable to algorithmic descriptions. And this is precisely where the power of Mathematics lies: by manipulating infinities, Mathematics goes way beyond the Church-Turing definition of computability. And what is Analysis if not manipulating infinities, through limits, convergence and the likes?"

- [Invisible manipulators of your mind](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/04/20/kahneman-tversky-invisible-mind-manipulators/)

> Sunstein and Thaler have described the political philosophy of such interventions as Libertarian Paternalism. It is “libertarian” because they do not impose mandates to narrow people’s choice, but merely frame choices or provide incentives that tend to make people “better off, as judged by themselves.” Their claim is that this form of influence, albeit often unconscious, is not manipulative or coercive because the possibility of a person choosing differently is not closed down." "The deeper concern that Lewis’s happy narrative omits entirely is that behavioral scientists claim to have developed the capacity to manipulate people’s emotional lives in ways that shape their fundamental preferences, values, and desires... The guiding idea for the World Well-Being Project is that we need not rely on our faulty subjective judgments about what will make us happy or what path in life will give us a sense of meaning.2 But if those studying behavioral influence are targeting the form of well-being that we value and the kind of happiness we seek, then it is harder to see how people’s being “better off, as judged by themselves” genuinely preserves their freedom.""

> Whatever the truth of Cambridge Analytica’s claims, the very existence of such companies tells us something important about the weight that unconscious influence, relative to reasoned argument, now plays in political campaigns... By now, behavioral strategies are in the open and are ubiquitous. The term “propaganda” has been replaced by “a behavioral approach to persuasive communication with quantifiable results.”

Politics

- [Guided by the Beauty of Our Weapon](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/); "Logical debate has one advantage over narrative, rhetoric, and violence: it’s an asymmetric weapon. That is, it’s a weapon which is stronger in the hands of the good guys than in the hands of the bad guys. In ideal conditions (which may or may not ever happen in real life) – the kind of conditions where everyone is charitable and intelligent and wise – the good guys will be able to present stronger evidence, cite more experts, and invoke more compelling moral principles. The whole point of logic is that, when done right, it can only prove things that are true... If you want people to be right more often than chance, you have to teach them ways to distinguish truth from falsehood. If this is in the face of enemy action, you will have to teach them so well that they cannot be fooled. You will have to do it person by person until the signal is strong and clear. You will have to raise the sanity waterline. There is no shortcut."

The cross product formula for angular momenta $\bold{q \times p = L}$ is an example of such maps. This answers my curiosity: the $\mathfrak{so}(3)$ Lie algebra can be identified with vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ via the cross product. These vectors in turn can be identified with either coordinates or momenta. How to generalize a construction like this that takes two copies of a Lie algebra to a new Lie algebra? -->

- [*An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Frontiers-Physics-ebook/dp/B0052TUEM8), Michael Peskin and Daniel Schroeder 1995; (Chapter 1-7) Pros: 1. Jumps right into QFT 2. Has everything, as it is often cited by other textbooks. Cons: 1. Jumps right into QFT without a preparation on special relativity and representation theory 2. Has everything but you can't find it until you already know what to look for. Hard to grasp a big picture
- [*A Modern Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Physics/dp/0198520743), Michele Maggiore 2005; Cons: Does not jump right into QFT. Pros: 1. Does not jump right into QFT but prepare a reader with special relativity and representation theory 2. Concise and modern (teaches the Wilsonian viewpoint of renormalization with block spin renormalization)
